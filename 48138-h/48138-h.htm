formed.</em></p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="drcap">T</span>he commissioners from a number of the northern
colonies being met at Albany, and considering the difficulties
that have always attended the most necessary
general measures for the common defence, or for the
annoyance of the enemy, when they were to be carried
through the several particular assemblies of all the colonies;
some assemblies being before at variance with
their governors or councils, and the several branches of
the government not on terms of doing business with
each other; others taking the opportunity, when their
concurrence is wanted, to push for favourite laws, powers,
or points, that they think could not at other times
be obtained, and so creating disputes and quarrels; one
assembly waiting to see what another will do, being
afraid of doing more than its share, or desirous of doing
less; or refusing to do any thing, because its country is
not at present so much exposed as others, or because
another will reap more immediate advantage; from one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>or other of which causes, the assemblies of six (out of
seven) colonies applied to, had granted no assistance to
Virginia, when lately invaded by the French, though
purposely convened, and the importance of the occasion
earnestly urged upon them; considering moreover,
that one principal encouragement to the French, in invading
and insulting the British American dominions,
was their knowledge of our disunited state, and of our
weakness arising from such want of union; and that
from hence different colonies were, at different times,
extremely harassed, and put to great expence both of
blood and treasure, who would have remained in peace,
if the enemy had had cause to fear the drawing on themselves
the resentment and power of the whole; the said
commissioners, considering also the present incroachments
of the French, and the mischievous consequences
that may be expected from them, if not opposed
with our force, came to an unanimous resolution,&mdash;<em>That
an union of the colonies is absolutely necessary for their
preservation</em>.</p>

<p>The manner of forming and establishing this union
was the next point. When it was considered, that the
colonies were seldom all in equal danger at the same
time, or equally near the danger, or equally sensible of
it; that some of them had particular interests to manage,
with which an union might interfere; and that
they were extremely jealous of each other; it was
thought impracticable to obtain a joint agreement of
all the colonies to an union, in which the expence and
burthen of defending any of them should be divided
among them all; and if ever acts of assembly in all the
colonies could be obtained for that purpose, yet as any
colony, on the least dissatisfaction, might repeal its own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
act and thereby withdraw itself from the union, it
would not be a stable one, or such as could be depended
on: for if only one colony should, on any disgust withdraw
itself, others might think it unjust and unequal
that they, by continuing in the union, should be at the
expence of defending a colony, which refused to bear its
proportionable part, and would therefore one after another,
withdraw, till the whole crumbled into its original
parts. Therefore the commissioners came to another
previous resolution, viz. <em>That it was necessary the union
should be established by act of parliament</em>.</p>

<p>They then proceeded to sketch out a <em>plan of union</em>,
which they did in a plain and concise manner, just sufficient
to show their sentiments of the kind of union
that would best suit the circumstances of the colonies,
be most agreeable to the people, and most effectually
promote his majesty's service and the general interest
of the British empire. This was respectfully sent to the
assemblies of the several colonies for their consideration,
and to receive such alterations and improvements
as they should think fit and necessary; after which it
was proposed to be transmitted to England to be perfected,
and the establishment of it there humbly solicited.</p>

<p>This was as much as the commissioners could do<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p class="center">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p class="center">II. <em>Reasons against partial Unions.</em></p>

<p>It was proposed by some of the commissioners, to
form the colonies into two or three distinct unions; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
for these reasons that proposal was dropped even by
those that made it: [viz.]</p>

<p>1. In all cases where the strength of the whole was
necessary to be used against the enemy, there would be
the same difficulty in degree, to bring the several unions
to unite together, as now the several colonies; and
consequently the same delays on our part and advantage
to the enemy.</p>

<p>2. Each union would separately be weaker than when
joined by the whole, obliged to exert more force, be
oppressed by the expence, and the enemy less deterred
from attacking it.</p>

<p>3. Where particular colonies have <em>selfish views</em>, as
New York with regard to Indian trade and lands;
or are less exposed, being covered by others, as New
Jersey, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maryland; or have
particular whims and prejudices against warlike measures
in general, as Pensylvania, where the Quakers
predominate; such colonies would have more weight in
a partial union, and be better able to oppose and obstruct
the measures necessary for the general good,
than where they are swallowed up in the general union.</p>

<p>4. The Indian trade would be better regulated by the
union of the whole than by partial unions. And as Canada
is chiefly supported by that trade, if it could be
drawn into the hands of the English (as it might be if
the Indians were supplied on moderate terms, and by
honest traders appointed by and acting for the public)
that alone would contribute greatly to the weakening
of our enemies.</p>

<p>5. The establishing of new colonies westward on the
Ohio and the lakes (a matter of considerable importance
to the increase of British trade and power, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
breaking that of the French, and to the protection and
security of our present colonies,) would best be carried
on by a joint union.</p>

<p>6. It was also thought, that by the frequent meetings-together
of commissioners or representatives from
all the colonies, the circumstances of the whole would
be better known, and the good of the whole better
provided for; and that the colonies would by this
connection learn to consider themselves, not as so
many independent states, but as members of the same
body; and thence be more ready to afford assistance
and support to each other, and to make diversions
in favour even of the most distant, and to join cordially
in any expedition for the benefit of all against the common
enemy.</p>

<p>These were the principal reasons and motives for
forming the plan of union as it stands. To which may
be added this, that as the union of the *******</p>

<p class="negidt1">III. <em>Plan of a proposed Union of the several Colonies of
Massachusett's Bay, New Hampshire, Connecticut,
Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pensylvania,
Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina,
for their mutual Defence and Security, and for extending
the British Settlements in North America, with
the Reasons and Motives for each Article of the Plan
[as far as could be remembered.]</em></p>

<p>It is proposed&mdash;That humble application be made
for an act of parliament of Great Britain, by virtue of
which one general government may be formed in America,
including all the said colonies, within and under
which government each colony may retain its present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
constitution, except in the particulars wherein a change
may be directed by the said act, as hereafter follows<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">PRESIDENT GENERAL, AND GRAND COUNCIL.</p>

<p><em>That the said general government be administered by a
president general, to be appointed and supported by the
crown; and a grand council, to be chosen by the representatives
of the people of the several colonies met in their respective
assemblies.</em></p>

<p>It was thought that it would be best the president general
should be supported as well as appointed by the crown;
that so all disputes between him and the grand council
concerning his salary might be prevented; as such disputes
have been frequently of mischievous consequence
in particular colonies, especially in time of public danger.
The quit-rents of crown-lands in America might
in a short time be sufficient for this purpose.&mdash;The
choice of members for the grand council is placed in
the house of representatives of each government, in order
to give the people a share in this new general government,
as the crown has its share by the appointment
of the president-general.</p>

<p>But it being proposed by the gentlemen of the council
of New York, and some other counsellors among
the Commissioners, to alter the plan in this particular,
and to give the governors and council of the several
provinces a share in the choice of the grand council, or
at least a power of approving and confirming or of disallowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the choice made by the house of representatives,
it was said:</p>

<p>"That the government or constitution proposed to
be formed by the plan, consists of two branches; a president
general appointed by the crown, and a council
chosen by the people, or by the people's representatives,
which is the same thing.</p>

<p>"That by a subsequent article, the council chosen
by the people can effect nothing without the consent
of the president general appointed by the crown; the
crown possesses therefore full one half of the power of
this constitution.</p>

<p>"That in the British constitution, the crown is supposed
to possess but one third, the lords having their
share.</p>

<p>"That this constitution seemed rather more favorable
for the crown.</p>

<p>"That it is essential, to English liberty, [that] the
subject should not be taxed but by his own consent, or
the consent of his elected representatives.</p>

<p>"That taxes to be laid and levied by this proposed
constitution will be proposed and agreed to by the representatives
of the people, if the plan in this particular
be preserved:</p>

<p>"But if the proposed alteration should take place,
it seemed as if matters may be so managed, as that the
crown shall finally have the appointment not only of
the president general, but of a majority of the grand
council; for seven out of eleven governors and councils
are appointed by the crown:</p>

<p>"And so the people in all the colonies would in
effect be taxed by their governors.</p>

<p>"It was therefore apprehended, that such alterations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of the plan would give great dissatisfaction, and that
the colonies could not be easy under such a power in
governors, and such an <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'infringment'">infringement</ins> of what they take
to be English liberty.</p>

<p>"Besides, the giving a share in the choice of the
grand council would not be equal with respect to all
the colonies, as their constitutions differ. In some,
both governor and council are appointed by the crown.
In others, they are both appointed by the proprietors.
In some, the people have a share in the choice of the
council; in others, both government and council are
wholly chosen by the people. But the house of representatives
is every where chosen by the people; and
therefore, placing the right of choosing the grand council
in the representatives is equal with respect to all.</p>

<p>"That the grand council is intended to represent all
the several houses of representatives of the colonies, as
a house of representatives doth the several towns or
counties of a colony. Could all the people of a colony
be consulted and unite in public measures, a house
of representatives would be needless: and could all the
assemblies conveniently consult and unite in general
measures, the grand council would be unnecessary.</p>

<p>"That a house of commons or the house of representatives,
and the grand council, are thus alike in their
nature and intention. And as it would seem improper
that the king or house of lords should have a power of
disallowing or appointing members of the house of
commons;&mdash;so likewise, that a governor and council
appointed by the crown should have a power of disallowing
or appointing members of the grand council
(who, in this constitution, are to be the representatives
of the people.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"If the governors and councils therefore were to
have a share in the choice of any that are to conduct
this general government, it should seem more proper
that they chose the president-general. But this being
an office of great trust and importance to the nation,
it was thought better to be filled by the immediate
appointment of the crown.</p>

<p>"The power proposed to be given by the plan to
the grand council is only a concentration of the powers
of the several assemblies in certain points for the general
welfare; as the power of the president general, is of
the powers of the several governors in the same points.</p>

<p>"And as the choice therefore of the grand council
by the representatives of the people, neither gives the
people any new powers, nor diminishes the power of
the crown, it was thought and hoped the crown would
not disapprove of it."</p>

<p>Upon the whole, the commissioners were of opinion,
that the choice was most properly placed in the representatives
of the people.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">ELECTION OF MEMBERS.</p>

<p><em>That within [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] months after the passing such act,
the house of representatives, that happen to be sitting within
that time, or that shall be especially for that purpose convened,
may and shall choose members for the grand council,
in the following proportion, that is to say,</em></p>

<p>It was thought, that if the least colony was allowed
two, and the others in proportion, the number would
be very great and the expence heavy; and that less
than two would not be convenient, as a single person,
being by any accident prevented appearing at the
meeting, the colony he ought to appear for would not
be represented. That as the choice was not immediately
popular, they would be generally men of good
abilities for business, and men of reputation for integrity;
and that forty-eight such men might be a number
sufficient. But, though it was thought reasonable,
that each colony should have a share in the representative
body in some degree, according to the proportion
it contributed to the general treasury: yet the proportion
of wealth or power of the colonies is not to be
judged by the proportion here fixed; because it was
at first agreed, that the greatest colony should not have
more than seven members, nor the least less than two:
and the settling these proportions between these two
extremes was not nicely attended to, as it would find
itself, after the first election from the sums brought
into the treasury, as by a subsequent article.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">PLACE OF FIRST MEETING.</p>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;<em>who shall meet for the first time at the city of Philadelphia
Pensylvania, being called by the president-general
as soon as conveniently may be after his appointment.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Philadelphia was named as being the nearer the
centre of the colonies, where the commissioners would
be well and cheaply accommodated. The high-roads,
through the whole extent, are for the most part very
good, in which forty or fifty miles a day may very well
be and frequently are travelled. Great part of the way
may likewise he gone by water. In summer time, the
passages are frequently performed in a week from
Charles Town to Philadelphia and New York; and
from Rhode Island to New York through the Sound, in
two or three days; and from New York to Philadelphia,
by water and land, in two days, by stage boats and
wheel-carriages that set out every other day. The
journey from Charles Town to Philadelphia may likewise
be facilitated by boats running up Chesapeak
Bay three hundred miles. But if the whole journey be
performed on horseback, the most distant members
(viz. the two from New Hampshire and from South
Carolina) may probably render themselves at Philadelphia
in fifteen or twenty days; the majority may be
there in much less time.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">NEW ELECTION.</p>

<p><em>That there shall be a new election of the members of the
grand council every three years; and on the death or
resignation of any member, his place shall be supplied by a
new choice at the next silting of the assembly of the colony
he represented.</em></p>

<p>Some colonies have annual assemblies, some continue
during a governor's pleasure; three years was
thought a reasonable medium, as affording a new
member time to improve himself in the business, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to act after such improvement; and yet giving opportunities,
frequent enough, to change him, if he has misbehaved.</p>

YEARS.</p>

<p><em>That after the first three years, when the proportion of
money arising out of each colony to the general treasury
can be known, the number of members to be chosen for
each colony shall from time to time, in all ensuing elections,
be regulated by that proportion (yet so as that the
number to be chosen by any one province be not more than
seven, nor less than two.)</em></p>

<p>By a subsequent article it is proposed, that the general
council shall lay and levy such general duties, as to
them may appear most equal and least burthensome,
&amp;c. Suppose, for instance, they lay a small duty or
excise on some commodity imported into or made in
the colonies, and pretty generally and equally used in
all of them; as rum perhaps, or wine; the yearly produce
of this duty or excise, if fairly collected, would
be in some colonies greater, in others less, as the colonies
are greater or smaller. When the collector's accounts
are brought in, the proportions will appear; and
from them it is proposed to regulate the proportion of
representatives to be chosen at the next general election,
within the limits however of seven and two.
These numbers may therefore vary in course of years,
as the colonies may in the growth and increase of people.
And thus the quota of tax from each colony would
naturally vary with its circumstances; thereby preventing
all disputes and dissatisfactions about the just proportions
due from each; which might otherwise produce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
pernicious consequences, and destroy the harmony
and good agreement that ought to subsist between
the several parts of the union.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">MEETINGS OF THE GRAND COUNCIL, AND CALL.</p>

<p><em>That the grand council shall meet once in every year,
and oftener if occasion require, at such time and place as
they shall adjourn to at the last preceding meeting, or as
they shall be called to meet at by the president general on
any emergency; he having first obtained in writing the
consent of seven of the members to such call, and sent due
and timely notice to the whole.</em></p>

<p>It was thought, in establishing and governing new
colonies or settlements, regulating Indian trade, Indian
treaties, &amp;c. there would be every year sufficient business
arise to require at least one meeting, and at such
meeting many things might be suggested for the benefit
of all the colonies. This annual meeting may either
be at a time or place certain, to be fixed by the president
general and grand council at their first meeting;
or left at liberty, to be at such time and place as they
shall adjourn to, or be called to meet at by the president
general.</p>

<p>In time of war it seems convenient, that the meeting
should be in that colony, which is nearest the seat of
action.</p>

<p>The power of calling them on any emergency seemed
necessary to be vested in the president general; but
that such power might not be wantonly used to harass
the members, and oblige them to make frequent long
journies to little purpose, the consent of seven at least
to such call was supposed a convenient guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">CONTINUANCE.</p>

<p><em>That the grand council have power to choose their speaker;
and shall neither be dissolved, prorogued, nor continued
sitting longer than six weeks at one time, without their
own consent or the special command of the crown.</em></p>

<p>The speaker should be presented for approbation; it
being convenient, to prevent misunderstandings and
disgusts, that the mouth of the council should be a
person agreeable, if possible, both to the council and
president general.</p>

<p>Governors have sometimes wantonly exercised the
power of proroguing or continuing the sessions of
assemblies, merely to harass the members and compel
a compliance; and sometimes dissolve them on
slight disgusts. This it was feared might be done by
the president general, if not provided against: and the
inconvenience and hardship would be greater in the
general government than in particular colonies, in
proportion to the distance the members must be from
home, during sittings, and the long journies some of
them must necessarily take.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">MEMBERS' ALLOWANCE.</p>

<p><em>That the members of the grand council shall be allowed
for their service ten shillings sterling per diem, during their
session and journey to and from the place of meeting;
twenty miles to be reckoned a day's journey.</em></p>

<p>It was thought proper to allow <em>some</em> wages, lest the
expence might deter some suitable persons from the
service;&mdash;and not to allow <em>too great</em> wages, lest unsuitable
persons should be tempted to cabal for the employment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
for the sake of gain. Twenty miles was set down
as a day's journey, to allow for accidental hinderances
on the road, and the greater expences of travelling
than residing at the place of meeting.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">ASSENT OF PRESIDENT GENERAL AND HIS DUTY.</p>

<p><em>That the assent of the president general be requisite to
all acts of the grand council; and that it be his office and
duty to cause them to be carried into execution.</em></p>

<p>The assent of the president general, to all acts of the
grand council was made necessary, in order to give the
crown its due share of influence in this government, and
connect it with that of Great Britain. The president
general, besides one half of the legislative power, hath
in his hands the whole executive power.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">POWER OF PRESIDENT GENERAL AND GRAND COUNCIL.
TREATIES OF PEACE AND WAR.</p>

<p><em>That the president general, with the advice of the grand
council, hold or direct all Indian treaties in which the general
interest of the colonies may be concerned; and make
peace or declare war with Indian nations.</em></p>

<p>The power of making peace or war with Indian nations
is at present supposed to be in every colony, and
is expressly granted to some by charter, so that no new
power is hereby intended to be granted to the colonies.
But as, in consequence of this power, one colony might
make peace with a nation that another was justly engaged
in war with; or make war on slight occasions
without the concurrence or approbation of neighbouring
colonies, greatly endangered by it; or make particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
treaties of neutrality in case of a general war, to
their own private advantage in trade, by supplying the
common enemy; of all which there have been instances&mdash;it
was thought better, to have all treaties of a general
nature under a general direction; that so the good of
the whole may be consulted and provided for.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">INDIAN TRADE.</p>

<p><em>That they make such laws as they judge necessary for
regulating all Indian trade.</em></p>

<p>Many quarrels and wars have arisen between the colonies
and Indian nations, through the bad conduct of
traders, who cheat the Indians after making them
drunk, &amp;c. to the great expence of the colonies both in
blood and treasure. Particular colonies are so interested
in the trade as not to be willing to admit such a
regulation as might be best for the whole; and therefore
it was thought best under a general direction.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">INDIAN PURCHASES.</p>

<p><em>That they make all purchases, from Indians for the
crown, of lands not now within the bounds of particular
colonies, or that shall not be within their bounds when some
of them are reduced to more convenient dimensions.</em></p>

<p>Purchases from the Indians, made by private persons,
have been attended with many inconveniences. They
have frequently interfered, and occasioned uncertainty
of titles, many disputes and expensive law-suits, and
hindered the settlement of the land so disputed. Then
the Indians have been cheated by such private purchases,
and discontent and wars have been the consequence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
These would be prevented by public fair
purchases.</p>

<p>Several of the colony charters in America extend
their bounds to the South Sea, which may be perhaps
three or four thousand miles in length to one or two
hundred miles in breadth. It is supposed they must in
time be reduced to dimensions more convenient for the
common purposes of government<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>Very little of the land in those grants is yet purchased
of the Indians.</p>

<p>It is much cheaper to purchase of them, than to take
and maintain the possession by force: for they are generally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
very reasonable in their demands for land<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>;
and the expence of guarding a large frontier against
their incursions is vastly great; because all must be
guarded, and always guarded, as we know not where or
when <em>to expect them</em><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">NEW SETTLEMENTS.</p>

<p><em>That they make new settlements on such purchases, by
granting lands in the king's name, reserving a quit-rent to
the crown for the use of the general treasury.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>It is supposed better that there should be one purchaser
than many; and that the crown should be that
purchaser, or the union in the name of the crown. By
this means the bargains may be more easily made, the
price not inhanced by numerous bidders, future disputes
about private Indian purchases, and monopolies of vast
tracts to particular persons (which are prejudicial to the
settlement and peopling of country) prevented; and the
land being again granted in small tracts to the settlers,
the quit-rents reserved may in time become a fund for
support of government, for defence of the country,
ease of taxes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Strong forts on the lakes, the Ohio, &amp;c. may, at the
same time they secure our present frontiers, serve to
defend new colonies settled under their protection; and
such colonies would also mutually defend and support
such forts, and better secure the friendship of the far
Indians.</p>

<p>A particular colony has scarce strength enough to
extend itself by new settlements, at so great a distance
from the old: but the joint force of the union might
suddenly establish a new colony or two in those parts,
or extend an old colony to particular passes, greatly to
the security of our present frontiers, increase of trade
and people, breaking off the French communication
between Canada and Louisiana, and speedy settlement
of the intermediate lands.</p>

<p>The power of settling new colonies is therefore
thought a valuable part of the plan, and what cannot
so well be executed by two unions as by one.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">LAWS TO GOVERN THEM.</p>

<p><em>That they make laws for regulating and governing such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
new settlements, till the crown shall think fit to form them
into particular governments.</em></p>

<p>The making of laws suitable for the new colonies, it
was thought, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'would he'">would be</ins> properly vested in the president
general and grand council; under whose protection
they will at first necessarily be, and who would be well
acquainted with their circumstances, as having settled
them. When they are become sufficiently populous,
they may by the crown be formed into complete and
distinct governments.</p>

<p>The appointment of a sub-president by the crown,
to take place in case of the death or absence of the
president general, would perhaps be an improvement
of the plan; and if all the governors of particular provinces
were to be formed into a standing council of
state, for the advice and assistance of the president general,
it might be another considerable improvement.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">RAISE SOLDIERS AND EQUIP VESSELS, &amp;C.</p>

<p><em>That they raise and pay soldiers and build forts for the
defence of any of the colonies, and equip vessels of force to
guard the coasts and protect the trade on the ocean, lakes<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>,
or great rivers; but they shall not impress men in any colony,
without the consent of the legislature.</em></p>

<p>It was thought, that quotas of men, to be raised and
paid by the several colonies, and joined for any public
service, could not always be got together with the necessary
expedition. For instance, suppose one thousand
men should be wanted in New Hampshire on any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
emergency; to fetch them by fifties and hundreds out
of every colony, as far as South Carolina, would be inconvenient,
the transportation chargeable and the occasion
perhaps passed before they could be assembled;
and therefore, that it would be best to raise them (by
offering bounty-money and pay) near the place where
they would be wanted, to be discharged again when the
service should be over.</p>

<p>Particular colonies are at present backward to build
forts at their own expence, which they say will be
equally useful to their neighbouring colonies; who refuse
to join, on a presumption that such forts <em>will</em> be
built and kept up, though they contribute nothing.
This unjust conduct weakens the whole; but the forts
being for the good of the whole, it was thought best
they should be built and maintained by the whole, out
of the common treasury.</p>

<p>In the time of war, small vessels of force are sometimes
necessary in the colonies to scour the coast of
small privateers. These being provided by the union
will be an advantage in turn to the colonies which are
situated on the sea, and whose frontiers on the land-side,
being covered by other colonies, reap but little
immediate benefit from the advanced forts.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">POWER TO MAKE LAWS, <ins class="corr" title="Errata applied: 'for DAY read LAY'">LAY</ins> DUTIES, &amp;C.</p>

<p><em>That for these purposes they have power to make laws,
and lay and levy such general duties, imports, or taxes, as
to them shall appear most equal and just (considering the
ability and other circumstances of the inhabitants in the
several colonies,) and such as may be collected with the least
inconvenience to the people; rather discouraging luxury,
than loading industry with unnecessary burthens.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The laws which the president general and grand
council are impowered to make <em>are such only</em> as shall
be necessary for the government of the settlements; the
raising, regulating, and paying soldiers for the general
service; the regulating of Indian trade; and laying and
collecting the general duties and taxes. (They should
also have a power to restrain the exportation of provisions
to the enemy from any of the colonies, on particular
occasions, in time of war.) But is it not intended
that they may interfere with the constitution and government
of the particular colonies; who are to be left
to their own laws, and to lay, levy, and apply their own
taxes as before.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">GENERAL TREASURER AND PARTICULAR TREASURER.</p>

<p><em>That they may appoint a general treasurer and particular
treasurer in each government when necessary; and from
time to time may order the sums in the treasuries of each
government into the general treasury; or draw on them for
special payments, as they find most convenient.</em></p>

<p>The treasurers here meant are only for the general
funds, and not for the particular funds of each colony,
which remain in the hands of their own treasurers at
their own disposal.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">MONEY HOW TO ISSUE.</p>

<p><em>Yet no money to issue but by joint orders of the president
general and grand council; except where sums have been
appropriated to particular purposes, and the president general
is previously impowered by an act to draw for such
sums.</em></p>

<p>To prevent misapplication of the money, or even application
that might be dissatisfactory to the crown or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the people, it was thought necessary, to join the president
general and grand council in all issues of money.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">ACCOUNTS.</p>

<p><em>That the general accounts shall be yearly settled and reported
to the several assemblies.</em></p>

<p>By communicating the accounts yearly to each assembly,
they will be satisfied of the prudent and honest
conduct of their representatives in the grand council.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">QUORUM.</p>

<p><em>That a quorum of the grand council, impowered to act
with the president general, do consist of twenty-five members;
among whom there shall be one or more from a majority
of the colonies.</em></p>

<p>The quorum seems large, but it was thought it would
not be satisfactory to the colonies in general, to have
matters of importance to the whole transacted by a
smaller number, or even by this number of twenty-five,
unless there were among them one at least from a majority
of the colonies; because otherwise, the whole
quorum being made up of members from three or four
colonies at one end of the union, something might be
done that would not be equal with respect to the rest,
and thence dissatisfactions and discords might rise to
the prejudice of the whole.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">LAWS TO BE TRANSMITTED.</p>

<p><em>That the laws made by them for the purposes aforesaid
shall not be repugnant, but, as near as may be, agreeable
to the laws of England, and shall be transmitted to the king
in council for approbation as soon as may be after their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
passing; and if not disapproved within three years after
presentation, to remain in force.</em></p>

<p>This was thought necessary for the satisfaction of
the crown, to preserve the connection of the parts of
the British empire with the whole, of the members with
the head, and to induce greater care and circumspection
in making of the laws, that they be good in themselves
and for the general benefit.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">DEATH OF THE PRESIDENT GENERAL.</p>

<p><em>That in case of the death of the president general, the
speaker of the grand council for the time being shall succeed,
and be vested with the same powers and authorities, to
continue till the king's pleasure be known.</em></p>

<p>It might be better, perhaps, as was said before, if the
crown appointed a vice president, to take place on the
death or absence of the president general; for so we
should be more sure of a suitable person at the head of
the colonies. On the death or absence of both, the
speaker to take place (or rather the eldest king's-governor)
till his majesty's pleasure be known.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">OFFICERS HOW APPOINTED.</p>

<p><em>That all military commission officers, whether for land
or sea-service, to act under this general constitution, shall
be nominated by the president general; but the approbation
of the grand council is to be obtained, before they receive
their commissions. And all civil officers are to be nominated
by the grand council, and to receive the president general's
approbation before they officiate.</em></p>

<p>It was thought it might be very prejudicial to the
service, to have officers appointed unknown to the people,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
or unacceptable, the generality of Americans serving
willingly under officers they know: and not caring
to engage in the service under strangers, or such as are
often appointed by governors through favour or interest.
The service here meant, is not the stated settled
service in standing troops; but any sudden and short
service, either for defence of our own colonies, or invading
the enemies country; (such as, the expedition
to Cape Breton in the last war; in which many substantial
farmers and tradesmen engaged as common
soldiers under officers of their own country, for whom
they had an esteem and affection; who would not have
engaged in a standing army, or under officers from
England.)&mdash;It was therefore thought best, to give the
council the power of approving the officers, which the
people will look upon as a great security of their being
good men. And without some such provision as this,
it was thought the expence of engaging men in the service
on any emergency would be much greater, and the
number who could be induced to engage much less;
and that therefore it would be most for the king's service
and general benefit of the nation, that the prerogative
should relax a little in this particular throughout
all the colonies in America; as it had already done
much more in the charters of some particular colonies,
viz. Connecticut and Rhode Island.</p>

<p>The civil officers will be chiefly treasurers and collectors
of taxes; and the suitable persons are most likely
to be known by the council.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">VACANCIES HOW SUPPLIED.</p>

<p><em>But in case of vacancy by death, or removal of any officer
civil or military under this constitution, the governor of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the province in which such vacancy happens may appoint,
till the pleasure of the president general and grand council
can be known.</em></p>

<p>The vacancies were thought best supplied by the governors
in each province, till a new appointment can be
regularly made; otherwise the service might suffer before
the meeting of the president general and grand
council.</p>


<p class="pfs70 mm2">EACH COLONY MAY DEFEND ITSELF ON EMERGENCY, &amp;C.</p>

<p><em>That the particular military as well as civil establishments
in each colony remain in their present state, the general
constitution notwithstanding; and that on sudden emergencies
any colony may defend itself, and lay the accounts of
expence thence arising before the president general and general
council, who may allow and order payment of the same,
as far as they judge such accounts just and reasonable.</em></p>

<p>Otherwise the union of the whole would weaken the
parts, contrary to the design of the union. The accounts
are to be judged of by the president general and grand
council, and allowed if found reasonable: this was
thought necessary to encourage colonies to defend
themselves, as the expence would be light when borne
by the whole; <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'and slso to'">and also to</ins> check imprudent and lavish
expence in such defences.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

causes which I cannot specify) their consent to it was not, in this respect,
universally expressed. Governor Pownall, however, says, "That he had
an opportunity of conversing with, and knowing the sentiments of the commissioners
appointed by their respective provinces, to attend this congress,
to which they were called by the crown; of learning from their experience
and judgment, the actual state of the American business and interest; and
of hearing amongst them, the grounds and reasons of that American union,
which they then had under deliberation, and transmitted the plan of to
England;" and he adds, in another place, "that the sentiments of our
colonies were collected in an authentic manner on this subject in the plan
proposed by Dr. Franklin, and unanimously agreed to in congress."

at Quebec, for obtaining an Assembly, has the following hint: "The vast
enlargement of the province of Quebec by adding to it a new territory that
contains, according to Lord Hillsborough's estimation, of it, five hundred
and eleven millions of acres (that is, more land than Spain, Italy, France,
and Germany put together, and most of it good land) is a measure that
would require an ample discussion."&mdash;&mdash;That the reader may not suspect
that these dimensions were convenient for uncommon purposes of government,
I shall quote the motives assigned upon this occasion by the act
regulating the government of Quebec. "By the arrangements made by
the royal proclamation, a very large extent of [outlying] country, within
which there were several colonies and settlements of the subjects of France,
who claimed to remain therein under the faith of the said treaty, was left
without any provision being made for the administration of civil government
therein:" <em>i. e.</em> a few Indian traders were a pretext for this appropriation
of a tract of country, which, according to the minister's estimate, was
more than thirteen times larger than England and Wales united, nearly
one hundred and twenty eight times larger than Jamaica, almost one-eighth
part of Europe, and considerably more than one-thirty-eighth part
of the whole habitable earth (comparing it with the several calculations in
The Political Survey of Great Britain, by Dr. Campbell, and in that of Jamaica,
by Mr. Long.) "Now <em>all</em> the inhabitants of the province of Quebec,"
says this very act, "amounted at the conquest to above sixty-five
thousand [only,] professing the religion of the church of Rome, and enjoying
an established form of constitution and system of laws." B.V.</p></div>

Indian knew how to set a true value upon a pair of spectacles: for undoubtedly

could be found, they would, on account of their great use, bear the same
price with diamonds." See Kalm's Travels into North America, Vol. I.
p. 386, 387. "At the time when the Swedes first arrived, they bought
land at a very inconsiderable price. For a piece of baize, or a pot full of
brandy, or the like, they could get a piece of ground, which at present
would be worth more than 290<em>l.</em> sterling." Ib. Vol. II. p. 118.&mdash;The truth
is, that the Indians considered their lands as mere <em>hunting-manors</em>, and
not as farms. B.&nbsp;V.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> To guard against the incursions of the Indians, a plan was sent over to
America (and, as I think, by authority) suggesting the expediency of
clearing away the woods and bushes from a tract of land, a mile in breadth,
and extending along the back of the colonies. Unfortunately, besides the
large expence of this undertaking (which, if one acre cost 2<em>l.</em> sterling, and
six hundred and forty acres make a square mile, is 128,000<em>l.</em> <em>first cost</em> for
every 100 miles) it was forgotten, that the Indians, like other people, knew
the difference between day and night, and that a mile of advance and another
of retreat were nothing to the celerity of such an enemy.&mdash;This plan,
it is said, was the work of Dean Tucker; and possibly might contain many
other particulars. The plans of Doctor Franklin and Governor Pownall
appear much more feasible. B.&nbsp;V.</p></div>

<p>I apprehend, that excluding the people of the colonies
from all share in the choice of the grand council
will give extreme dissatisfaction; as well as the taxing
them by act of parliament, where they have no representation.
It is very possible, that this general government
might be as well and faithfully administered without
the people, as with them; but where heavy burdens
are to be laid upon them, it has been found useful,
to make it as much as possible their own act; for they
bear better, when they have, or think they have, some
share in the direction; and when any public measures
are generally grievous, or even distasteful, to the people,
the wheels of government move more heavily.</p>

Chronicle for Feb. 6-8, 1766, with an introduction signed <em>A Lover of
Britain</em>. In the beginning of the year 1776, they were republished in Almon's
Remembrancer, with an additional prefatory piece, under the signature
of <em>A Mourner over our Calamities</em>.&mdash;I shall explain the subject of
them in the words of one of these writers. "The Albany Plan of Union
was sent to the government here for approbation: had it been approved
and established by authority from hence, English America thought itself
sufficiently able to cope with the French, without other assistance; several
of the colonies having alone, in former wars, withstood the whole power of
the enemy, unassisted not only by the mother-country, but by any of the
neighbouring provinces.&mdash;The plan, however, was not approved here; but
a <em>New one</em> was formed instead of it; by which it was proposed, that 'the
governors of all the colonies, attended by one or two members of their
respective councils, should assemble, and concert measures for the defence
of the whole, erect forts where they judged proper, and raise what troops
they thought necessary, with power to draw on the treasury here for the
sums that should be wanted, and the treasury to be reimbursed by a <em>tax laid
on the colonies by act of parliament</em>.'&mdash;This <em>New plan</em> being communicated
by Governor Shirley to a gentleman of Philadelphia (Dr. Franklin) then
in Boston (who hath very eminently distinguished himself, before and
since that time, in the literary world, and whose judgment, penetration,
and candor, as well as his readiness and ability to suggest, forward, or
carry into execution, every scheme of public utility, hath most deservedly
endeared him, not only to our fellow-subjects throughout the continent of
North America, but to his numberless friends on this side the Atlantic) occasioned
the following remarks from him, which perhaps may contribute
in some degree to its being laid aside. As they very particularly show
the then sentiments of the Americans on the subject of a parliamentary tax,
before the French power in that country was subjected, and before the late
restraints on their commerce; they satisfy me, and I hope they will convince
your readers (contrary to what has been advanced by some of your
correspondents) that those particulars have had no share in producing the
present opposition to such a tax, nor in disturbances occasioned by it,
which these papers indeed do almost prophetically foretel. For this purpose,
having accidentally fallen into my hands, they are communicated to
you by one who is, not <em>partially</em>, but in the <em>most enlarged sense</em>,

imposed without Consent, indirect Taxes, and the Albany Plan
of Union</em>.</a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Wednesday Morning.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>I mentioned it yesterday to your excellency as
my opinion, that excluding the people of the colonies
from all share in the choice of the grand council
would <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'problably give'">probably give</ins> extreme dissatisfaction, as well
as the taxing them by act of parliament, where they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
have no representation. In matters of general concern
to the people, and especially where burdens are to be
laid upon them; it is of use to consider, as well what
they will be apt to think and say, as what they ought
to think: I shall therefore, as your excellency requires
it of me, briefly mention what of either kind occurs to
me on this occasion.</p>

<p>First, they will say, and perhaps with justice, that the
body of the people in the colonies are as loyal, and as
firmly attached to the present constitution, and reigning
family, as any subjects in the king's dominions.</p>

<p>That there is no reason to doubt the readiness and
willingness of the representatives they may choose, to
grant from time to time such supplies for the defence
of the country, as shall be judged necessary, so far as
their abilities will allow.</p>

<p>That the people in the colonies, who are to feel the
immediate mischiefs of invasion and conquest by an
enemy, in the loss of their estates, lives, and liberties,
are likely to be better judges of the quantity of forces
necessary to be raised and maintained, forts to be built
and supported, and of their own abilities to bear the expence
than the parliament of England, at so great a
distance.</p>

<p>That governors often come to the colonies merely to
make fortunes, with which they intend to return to Britain;
are not always men of the best abilities or integrity;
have many of them no estates here, nor any natural
connections with us, that should make them heartily
concerned for our welfare; and might possibly be
fond of raising and keeping up more forces than necessary,
from the profits accruing to themselves, and to
make provision for their friends and dependents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>That the counsellors in most of the colonies, being
appointed by the crown, on the recommendation of governors,
are often persons of small estates, frequently
dependent on the governors for offices, and therefore
too much under influence.</p>

<p>That there is therefore great reason to be jealous of
a power, in such governors and councils, to raise such
sums as they shall judge necessary, by drafts on the
lords of the treasury, to be afterwards laid on the colonies
by act of parliament, and paid by the people here;
since they might abuse it, by projecting useless expeditions,
harassing the people, and taking them from
their labour to execute such projects, merely to create
offices and employments, and gratify their dependents,
and divide profits.</p>

<p>That the parliament of England is at a great distance,
subject to be misinformed and misled by such
governors and councils, whose united interests might
probably secure them against the effect of any complaint
from hence.</p>

<p>That it is supposed an undoubted right of Englishmen,
not to be taxed but by their own consent, given
through their representatives:</p>

<p>That the colonies have no representatives in parliament.</p>

<p>That to propose taxing them by parliament, and refuse
them the liberty of choosing a representative council,
to meet in the colonies, and consider and judge of
the necessity of any general tax, and the quantum,
shows a suspicion of their loyalty to the crown, or of
their regard for their country, or of their common sense
and understanding; which they have not deserved.</p>

<p>That compelling the colonies to pay money without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
their consent, would be rather like raising contributions
in an enemy's country, than taxing of Englishmen for
their own public benefit.</p>

<p>That it would be treating them as a conquered people,
and not as true British subjects.</p>

<p>That a tax laid by the representatives of the colonies
might be easily lessened as the occasions should lessen;
but, being once laid by parliament under the influence of
the representations made by governors, would probably
be kept up, and continued for the benefit of governors;
to the grievous burthen and discontentment of the colonies,
and prevention of their growth and increase.</p>

<p>That a power in governors, to march the inhabitants
from one end of the British and French colonies to the
other, being a country of at least one thousand five
hundred miles long, without the approbation or the
consent of their representatives first obtained to such
expeditions, might be grievous and ruinous to the people,
and would put them upon a footing with the subjects
of France in Canada, that now groan under such
oppression from their governor, who for two years past
has harrassed them with long and destructive marches
to Ohio.</p>

<p>That if the colonies in a body may be well governed
by governors and councils appointed by the crown,
without representatives; particular colonies may as
well, or better be so governed; a tax may be laid upon
them all by act of parliament for support of government;
and their assemblies may be dismissed as an useless
part of the constitution.</p>

<p>That the powers proposed by the Albany plan of
union, to be vested in a grand council representative of
the people, even with regard to military matters, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
not so great, as those which the colonies of Rhode Island
and Connecticut are entrusted with by their charters,
and have never abused; for by this plan, the president
general is appointed by the crown, and controls all by
his negative; but in those governments, the people
choose the governor, and yet allow him no negative.</p>

<p>That the British colonies bordering on the French
are properly frontiers of the British empire; and the
frontiers of an empire are properly defended at the
joint expence of the body of the people in such empire:&mdash;it
would now be thought hard by act of parliament
to oblige the Cinque ports or sea coasts of Britain,
to maintain the whole navy, because they are more immediately
defended by it, not allowing them at the
same time a vote in choosing members of the parliament;
and, as the frontiers of America bear the expence
of their own defence, it seems hard to allow them
no share in voting the money, judging of the necessity
and sum, or advising the measures.</p>

<p>That besides the taxes necessary for the defence of
the frontiers, the colonies pay yearly great sums to the
mother-country unnoticed:&mdash;for 1. Taxes paid in Britain
by the landholder or artificer must enter into and
increase the price of the produce of land and manufactures
made of it; and great part of this is paid by consumers
in the colonies, who thereby pay a considerable
part of the British taxes.</p>

<p>2. We are restrained in our trade with foreign nations;
and where we could be supplied with any manufacture
cheaper from them, but must buy the same
dearer from Britain, the difference of price is a clear
tax to Britain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>3. We are obliged to carry a great part of our produce
directly to Britain; and where the duties laid
upon it lessen its price to the planter, or it sells for less
than it would in foreign markets, the difference is a tax
paid to Britain.</p>

<p>4. Some manufactures we could make, but are forbidden,
and must take them of British merchants: the
whole price is a tax paid to Britain.</p>

<p>5. By our greatly encreasing the demand and consumption
of British manufactures, their price is considerably
raised of late years; the advantage is clear profit
to Britain, and enables its people better to pay great
taxes; and much of it being paid by us, is clear tax to
Britain.</p>

<p>6. In short, as we are not suffered to regulate our trade,
and restrain the importation and consumption of British
superfluities (as Britain can the consumption of
foreign superfluities) our whole wealth centers finally
amongst the merchants and inhabitants of Britain; and
if we make them richer, and enable them better to pay
their taxes, it is nearly the same as being taxed ourselves,
and equally beneficial to the crown.</p>

<p>These kind of secondary taxes, however, we do not
complain of, though we have no share in the laying or
disposing of them: but to pay immediate heavy taxes,
in the laying, appropriation, and disposition of which,
we have no part, and which perhaps we may know to
be as unnecessary as grievous, must seem hard measure
to Englishmen, who cannot conceive, that by hazarding
their lives and fortunes in subduing and settling
new countries, extending the dominion, and increasing
the commerce of the mother-nation, they have forfeited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the native rights of Britons; which they think ought
rather to be given to them, as due to such merit, if they
had been before in a state of slavery. &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p>These, and such kinds of things as these, I apprehend,
will be thought and said by the people, if the proposed
alteration of the Albany plan should take place. Then
the administration of the board of governors and council
so appointed, not having the representative body of
the people to approve and unite in its measures, and
conciliate the minds of the people to them, will probably
become suspected and odious; dangerous animosities
and feuds will arise between the governors and governed;
and every thing go into confusion.</p>

<p>Perhaps I am too apprehensive in this matter; but
having freely given my opinion and reasons, your excellency
can judge better than I, whether there be any
weight in them, and the shortness of the time allowed
me will I hope in some degree excuse the imperfections
of this scrawl.</p>

to be</p>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Boston, Dec. 22, 1754.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>Since the conversation your excellency was pleased
to honour me with, on the subject of <em>uniting the colonies</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
more intimately with Great Britain, by allowing them
<em>representatives in parliament</em>, I have something further
considered that matter, and am of opinion, that such
an union would be very acceptable to the colonies, provided
they had a reasonable number of representatives
allowed them; and that all the old acts of parliament
restraining the trade or cramping the manufactures of
the colonies be at the same time repealed, and the British
subjects <em>on this side the water</em> put, in those respects,
on the same footing with those in Great Britain, till
the new parliament, representing the whole, shall think
it for the interest of the whole to re-enact some or all
of them: it is not that I imagine so many representatives
will be allowed the colonies, as to have any great
weight by their numbers; but I think there might be
sufficient to occasion those laws to be better and more
impartially considered, and perhaps to overcome the interest
of a petty corporation, or of any particular set of
artificers or traders in England, who heretofore seem,
in some instances, to have been more regarded than all
the colonies, or than was consistent with the general
interest, or best natural good. I think too, that the government
of the colonies by a parliament, in which
they are fairly represented, would be vastly more agreeable
to the people, than the method lately attempted to
be introduced by royal instruction; as well as more
agreeable to the nature of an English constitution, and
to English liberty; and that such laws, as now seem to
bear hard on the colonies, would (when judged by such
a parliament for the best interest of the whole) be more
cheerfully submitted to, and more easily executed.</p>

<p>I should hope too, that by such an union, the people
of Great Britain, and the people of the colonies, would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
learn to consider themselves, as not belonging to different
communities with different interest, but to one
community with one interest; which I imagine would
contribute to strengthen the whole, and greatly lessen
the danger of future separations.</p>

<p>It is, I <ins class="corr" title="Errata applied: 'for iuppose read suppose'">suppose</ins>, agreed to be the general interest of
any state, that its people be numerous and rich; men
enow to fight in its defence, and enow to pay sufficient
taxes to defray the charge; for these circumstances
tend to the security of the state, and its protection from
foreign power. But it seems not of so much importance,
whether the fighting be done by John or Thomas,
or the tax paid by William or Charles. The <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'iron mafacture'">iron manufacture</ins>
employs and enriches British subjects, but is it
of any importance to the state, whether the manufacturer
lives at Birmingham or Sheffield, or both; since
they are still within its bounds, and their wealth and
persons still at its command? Could the Goodwin Sands
be laid dry by banks, and land equal to a large country
thereby gained to England, and presently filled with
English inhabitants, would it be right to deprive such
inhabitants of the common privileges enjoyed by other
Englishmen, the right of vending their produce in the
same ports, or of making their own shoes; because a
merchant or a shoemaker, living on the old land, might
fancy it more for his advantage to trade or make shoes
for them? Would this be right, even if the land were
gained at the expence of the state? And would it not
seem less right, if the charge and labour of gaining the
additional territory to Britain had been borne by the
settlers themselves? and would not the hardship appear
yet greater, if the people of the new country should be allowed
no representatives in the parliament enacting such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
impositions? Now I look on the colonies as so many
countries gained to Great Britain, and more advantageous
to it, than if they had been gained out of the
seas around its coasts, and joined to its lands; for being
in different climates, they afford greater variety of produce,
and materials for more manufactures; and being
separated by the ocean, they increase much more its
shipping and seamen: and, since they are all included
in the British empire, which has only extended itself
by their means; and the strength and wealth of the
parts is the strength and wealth of the whole; what
imports it to the general state, whether a merchant, a
smith, or a hatter, grow rich in Old or New England?
and if, through increase of people, two smiths are
wanted for one employed before, why may not the <em>new</em>
smith be allowed to live and thrive in the <em>new</em> country,
as well as the <em>old</em> one in the <em>old</em>? In fine, why should
the countenance of a state be <em>partially</em> afforded to its
people, unless it be most in favour of those who have most
merit? and if there be any difference, those who have
most contributed to enlarge Britain's empire and commerce,
increase her strength, her wealth, and the numbers
of her people, at the risque of their own lives and
private fortunes in new and strange countries, methinks
ought rather to expect some preference. With the
greatest respect and esteem, I have the honour to be</p>

<p>The great country back of the Apalachian mountains,
on both sides the Ohio, and between that river
and the lakes is now well known, both to the English
and French, to be one of the finest in North America,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
for the extreme richness and fertility of the land; the
healthy temperature of the air, and mildness of the climate;
the plenty of hunting, fishing, and fowling; the
facility of trade with the Indians; and the vast convenience
of inland navigation or water-carriage by the
lakes and great rivers, many hundred of leagues around.</p>

<p>From these natural advantages it must undoubtedly
(perhaps in less than another century) become a populous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and powerful dominion; and a great accession of
power, either to England or France.</p>

<p>The French are now making open encroachments
on these territories, in defiance of our known rights;
and, if we longer delay to settle that country, and suffer
them to possess it,&mdash;these <em>inconveniences and mischiefs</em>
will probably follow:</p>

<p>1. Our people, being confined to the country between
the sea and the mountains, cannot much more increase
in number; people increasing in proportion to their
room and means of subsistence. (See the Observations
on the Increase of Mankind, &amp;c. Vol. II.)</p>

<p>2. The French will increase much more, by that acquired
room and plenty of subsistence, and become a
great people behind us.</p>

<p>3. Many of our debtors, and loose English people,
our German servants, and slaves, will probably desert
to them, and increase their numbers and strength, to
the lessening and weakening of ours.</p>

<p>4. They will cut us off from all commerce and alliance
with the western Indians, to the great prejudice
of Britain, by preventing the sale and consumption of
its manufactures.</p>

<p>5. They will both in time of peace and war (as they
have always done against New England) set the Indians
on to harrass our frontiers, kill and scalp our people, and
drive in the advanced settlers; and so, in preventing
our obtaining more subsistence by cultivating of new
lands, they discourage our marriages, and keep our people
from increasing; thus (if the expression may be allowed)
killing thousands of our children before they are
born. &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>If two strong colonies of English were settled between
the Ohio and lake Erie, in the places hereafter
to be mentioned,&mdash;these advantages might be expected:</p>

<p>1. They would be a great security to the frontiers of
our other colonies; by preventing the incursions of the
French and French Indians of Canada, on the back
parts of Pensylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas;
and the frontiers of such new colonies would
be much more easily defended, than those of the colonies
last mentioned now can be, as will appear hereafter.</p>

<p>2. The dreaded junction of the French settlements in
Canada with those of Louisiana would be prevented.</p>

<p>3. In case of a war, it would be easy, from those new
colonies, to annoy Louisiana, by going down the Ohio
and Mississippi; and the southern part of Canada, by
sailing over the lakes; and thereby confine the French
within narrower limits.</p>

<p>4. We should secure the friendship and trade of the
Miamis or Twigtwees (a numerous people, consisting
of many tribes, inhabiting the country between the
west end of lake Erie, and the south end of lake Hurons,
and the Ohio) who are at present dissatisfied with
the French, and fond of the English, and would gladly
encourage and protect an infant English settlement in
or near their country, as some of their chiefs have declared
to the writer of this memoir. Further, by means
of the lakes, the Ohio, and the Mississippi, our trade
might be extended through a vast country, among
many numerous and distant nations, greatly to the benefit
of Britain.</p>

<p>5. The settlement of all the intermediate lands, between
the present frontiers of our colonies on one side,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and the lakes and Mississippi on the other, would be
facilitated and speedily executed, to the great increase
of Englishmen, English trade, and English power.</p>

<p>The grants to most of the colonies are of long narrow
slips of land, extending west from the Atlantic to
the South Sea. They are much too long for their
breadth; the extremes at too great a distance; and
therefore unfit to be continued under their present dimensions.</p>

<p>Several of the old colonies may conveniently be limited
westward by the Allegeny or Apalachian mountains;
and new colonies formed west of those mountains.</p>

<p>A single old colony does not seem strong enough to
extend itself otherwise than inch by inch: it cannot
venture a settlement far distant from the main body,
being unable to support it: but if the colonies were
united under one governor-general and grand council,
agreeable to the Albany plan, they might easily, by their
joint force, establish one or more new colonies, whenever
they should judge it necessary or advantageous to
the interest of the whole.</p>

<p>But if such union should not take place, it is proposed
that two charters be granted, <em>each</em> for some considerable
part of the lands west of Pensylvania and the
Virginian mountains, to a number of the nobility and
gentry of Britain; with such Americans as shall join
them in contributing to the settlement of those lands,
either by paying a proportion of the expence of making
such settlements, or by actually going thither in person,
and settling themselves and families.</p>

<p>That by such charters it be granted, that every actual
settler be intitled to a tract of [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] acres for himself,
and [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] acres for every poll in the family he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
carries with him; and that every contributor of [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]
guineas be intitled to a quantity of acres, equal to the
share of a single settler, for every such sum of [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]
guineas contributed and paid to the colony treasurer;
a contributor for [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] shares to have an additional
share <em>gratis</em>; that settlers may likewise be contributors,
and have right of land in both capacities.</p>

<p>That as many and as great privileges and powers of
government be granted to the contributors and settlers,
as his majesty in his wisdom shall think most fit for
their benefit and encouragement, consistent with the
general good of the British empire; for extraordinary
privileges and liberties, with lands on easy terms, are
strong inducements to people to hazard their persons
and fortunes in settling new countries; and such powers
of government as (though suitable to the circumstances,
and fit to be trusted with an infant colony)
might be judged unfit, when it becomes populous and
powerful; these might be granted for a term only; as
the choice of their own governor for ninety-nine years;
the support of government in the colonies of Connecticut
and Rhode Island (which <em>now</em> enjoy that and other
like privileges) being much less expensive, than in the
colonies under the immediate government of the crown,
and the constitution more inviting.</p>

<p>That the first contributors to the amount of [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]
guineas be empowered to choose a treasurer to receive
the contribution.</p>

<p>That no contributions be paid till the sum of [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]
thousand guineas be subscribed.</p>

<p>That the money thus raised be applied to the purchase
of the lands from the Six Nations and other Indians,
and of provisions, stores, arms, ammunition, carriages,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
&amp;c. for <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'thesettlers'">the settlers</ins>; who, after having entered their
names with the treasurer, or person by him appointed
to receive and enter them, are, upon public notice given
for that purpose, to rendezvous at a place to be appointed,
and march in a body to the place destined for
their settlement, under the [charge] of the government
to be established over them. Such rendezvous and
march however not to directed, till the number of names
of settlers entered, capable of bearing arms, amount at
least to [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] thousand. &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p>It is apprehended, that a great sum of money might
be raised in America on such a scheme as this; for
there are many who would be glad of any opportunity,
by advancing a small sum at present, to secure land for
their children, which might in a few years become very
valuable; and a great number it is thought of actual
settlers might likewise be engaged (some from each
of our present colonies) sufficient to carry it into full
execution by their strength and numbers; provided only,
that the crown would be at the expence of removing
the little forts the French have erected in their incroachments
on his majesty's territories, and supporting
a strong one near the falls of Niagara, with a few small
armed vessels, or half-galleys to cruize on the lakes.
* * * * * &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p>For the security of this colony in its infancy, a small
fort might be erected and for some time maintained at
Buffalonic on the Ohio, above the settlement; and another
at the mouth of the Hioaga, on the south side of
lake Erie, where a port should be formed, and a town
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
erected, for the trade of the lakes.&mdash;The colonists for
<em>this settlement</em> might march by land through Pensylvania. &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p>The river Siotha, which runs into the Ohio about
two hundred miles below Logs Town, is supposed the
fittest seat for the <em>other colony</em>; there being for forty
miles on each side of it and quite up to its heads a
body of all rich land; the finest spot of its bigness in
all North America, and has the particular advantage of
sea-coal in plenty (even above ground in two places)
for fuel, when the woods shall be destroyed. This
colony would have the trade of the Miamis or Twigtwees;
and should, at first, have a small fort near Hock-kockin,
at the head of the river; and another near the
mouth of Wabash. Sandoski, a French fort near the
lake Erie, should also be taken; and all the little French
forts south and west of the lakes, quite to the Mississippi,
be removed, or taken and garrisoned by the English.&mdash;The
colonists for this settlement might assemble
near the heads of the rivers in Virginia, and march
over land to the navigable branches of the Kanhawa,
where they might embark with all their baggage and
provisions, and fall into the Ohio, not far above the
mouth of Siotha. Or they might rendezvous at Will's
Creek, and go down the Mohingahela to the Ohio.</p>

<p>The fort and armed vessels at the strait of Niagara
would be a vast security to the frontiers of these new
colonies against any attempts of the French from Canada.
The fort at the mouth of the Wabash would
guard that river, the Ohio, and Cutava river, in case of
any attempt from the French of Mississippi. (Every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
fort should have a small settlement round it; as the
fort would protect the settlers, and the settlers defend
the fort and supply it with provisions.) &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p>The difficulty of settling the first English colonies in
America, at so great a distance from England, must
have been vastly greater, than the settling these proposed
new colonies: for it would be the interest and
advantage of all the present colonies to support these
new ones; as they would cover their frontiers, and prevent
the growth of the French power behind or near
their present settlements; and the new country is nearly
at equal distance from all the old colonies, and could
easily be assisted from all of them.</p>

<p>And as there are already in the old colonies many
thousands of families that are ready to swarm, wanting
more land; the richness and natural advantage of the
Ohio country would draw most of them thither, were
there but a tolerable prospect of a safe settlement. So
that the new colonies would soon be full of people;
and from the advantage of their situation, become much
more terrible to the French settlements, than those are
now to us. The gaining of the back Indian trade from
the French, by the navigation of the lakes, &amp;c. would
of itself greatly weaken our enemies:&mdash;it being now
their principal support, it seems highly probable, that
in time they must be subjected to the British crown, or
driven out of the country.</p>

<p>Such settlements may better be made now, than fifty
years hence, because it is easier to settle ourselves, and
thereby prevent the French settling there as they seem
now to intend, than to remove them when strongly
settled.</p>

<p>If these settlements are postponed, then more forts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and stronger, and more numerous and expensive garrisons
must be established, to secure the country, prevent
their settling, and secure our present frontiers; the
charge of which may probably exceed the charge of
the proposed settlements, and the advantage nothing
near so great.</p>

<p>The fort at Oswego should likewise be strengthened,
and some armed half-gallies, or other small vessels, kept
there to cruise on lake Ontario, as proposed by Mr.
Pownall in his paper laid before the commissioners at
the Albany treaty<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.</p>

<p>If a fort was also built at Tirondequat on lake Ontario
and a settlement made there near the lake side,
where the lands are said to be good, (much better than
at Oswego;) the people of such settlements would help
to defend both forts on any emergency<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> For the occasion which produced this plan, see what follows. I apprehend
it was given to Governor Pownall, 1754, for the purpose of being
inserted in his memorial; but this point of anecdote I cannot sufficiently
ascertain.
</p>
<p>
"Extract of a Memorial drawn up by Order of, and presented to his Royal
Highness the Duke of Cumberland, 1756, by T. Pownall.
</p>
<p>
"In other parts of our frontier, that are not the immediate residence
and country of Indians, some other species of barrier should be thought
of, of which nothing can be more effectual than a barrier colony: but even
this cannot be carried ... into execution and effect,
without the previous measure of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrepôts</i> in the country between us and
the enemy.... All mankind must know, that no body of
men, whether as an army, or as an emigration of colonists, can march from
one country to another, through an inhospitable wilderness, without magazines;
nor with any safety, without posts communicating among each
other by practicable roads, to which to retire in case of accidents, repulse,
or delay.
</p>
<p>
"It is a fact, which experience evinces the truth of, that we have always
been able to outsettle the French; and have driven the Indians out of the
country more by settling than fighting; and that whenever our settlements
have been wisely and completely made, the French, neither by themselves
nor their dogs of war, the Indians, have been able to remove us. It is upon
this fact I found the propriety of the measure of settling a barrier colony in
those parts of our frontiers, <em>which are not the immediate residence or hunting-grounds
of our</em> Indians. This is a measure that will be effectual; and
will not only in time pay its expence, but make as great returns as any of
our present colonies do; will give a strength and unity to our dominions in
North America; and give us possession of the country, as well as settlement
in it. But above all this, the state and circumstances of our settlements
render such a measure not only proper and eligible, but absolutely
necessary. The English settlements, as they are at present circumstanced,
are absolutely at a stand; they are settled up to the mountains: and in
the mountains there is no where together land sufficient for a settlement
large enough to subsist by itself, and to defend itself, and preserve a communication
with the present settlements.
</p>
<p>
"If the English would advance one step further, or cover themselves
where they are, it must be at once, by one large step over the mountains,
with a numerous and military colony. Where such should be settled, I do
not take upon me to say: at present I shall only point out the measure and
the nature of it, by inserting two schemes, one of Mr. Franklin's, the other
of your memorialist; and if I might indulge myself with scheming, I
should imagine that two such were sufficient, and only requisite and proper:
one at the back of Virginia, filling up the vacant space between the
five nations and southern confederacy, and connecting, into one system,
our barrier; the other somewhere in the Cohass or Connecticut river, or
wherever best adapted to cover the New England colonies. These, with
the little settlements mentioned above in the Indian countries, complete my
idea of this branch." See Governor Pownall's Administration of the Colonies.
Vol. II. p. 228-231, 5th edition.
</p>
<p>
The reader must carry along with him a distinction between the plans
of Dr. Franklin and Governor Pownall here referred to. The first (which
is before him) is particular, and proposes a plan for <em>two</em> settlements in the
unlocated lands to the westward of Pensylvania and the Virginian mountains,
and is totally silent with respect to a settlement in New England:
the other treats of the mode of settling new colonies in North America in
general, leaving the precise situation to be in some measure pointed out
by the foregoing extract.

<h3 class="negidt1"><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Report of the Committee of Aggrievances of the Assembly of Pensylvania,
dated Feb. 22, 1757.</em></a><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></h3>

<p>In obedience to the order of the house, we have
drawn up the heads of the most important aggrievances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
that occur to us, which the people of this province with
great difficulty labour under; the many infractions of
the constitution (in manifest violation of the royal
grant, the proprietary charter, the laws of this province,
and of the laws, usages, and customs of our mother-country)
and other matters; which we apprehend call
aloud for redress.</p>

<p>They are as follow:</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p><em>First</em>, By the royal charter (which has ever been,
ought to be, and truly is, the principal and invariable
fundamental of this constitution) King Charles the Second
did give and grant unto William Penn, his heirs
and assigns, the province of Pensylvania; and also to
him and his heirs, and his or their <em>deputies</em> or lieutenants,
free, full, and absolute power, for the good and
happy government thereof, to make and enact any laws,
"according to their best discretion; by and with the
advice, assent, and approbation of the <em>freemen</em> of the
said country, or of their delegates or deputies;" for the
raising of money, or any other end appertaining to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
public state, peace, or safety of the said country. By
the words of this grant, it is evident, that full powers
are granted to the <em>deputies</em> and lieutenants of William
Penn and his heirs, to concur with the people in framing
laws for their protection and the safety of the province,
according to their best discretion; independent
of any instructions or directions they should receive
from their <em>principals</em>. And it is equally obvious to your
committee, that the <em>people</em> of this province and their representatives
were interested in this royal grant; and by
virtue thereof have an original right of legislation inherent
in them; which neither the proprietors nor any
other person whatsoever can divest them of, restrain,
or abridge, without manifestly violating and destroying
the letter, spirit, and design of this grant.</p>

<p>Nevertheless we unfortunately find, that the proprietaries
of this province, regardless of this sacred fundamental
of our rights and liberties, have so abridged
and restricted their late and present <em>governor's</em> discretion
in matters of legislation, by their illegal, impracticable,
and unconstitutional instructions and prohibitions; that
no bill for granting aids and supplies to our most gracious
sovereign (be it ever so reasonable, expedient, and
necessary for the defence of this his majesty's colony,
and safety of his people) unless it be agreeable thereto,
can meet with his approbation: by means whereof the
many considerable sums of money which have been offered
for those purposes, by the assemblies of this province
(ever anxious to maintain his honour and rights,)
have been rejected; to the great encouragement of his
majesty's enemies, and the imminent danger of the loss
of this colony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<p class="p2" />
<p><em>Secondly</em>, The representatives of the people in general
assembly met, by virtue of the said royal grant, and
the charter of privileges granted by the said William
Penn, and a law of this province, have right to, and
ought to enjoy all the powers and privileges of an assembly,
according to the rights of the free-born subjects
of England, and as is usual in any of the plantations
in America: [also] it is an indubitable and now an incontested
right of the commons of England, to <em>grant
aids</em> and supplies to his majesty in any manner they
think most easy to themselves and the people; and
they [also] are the sole judges of the <em>measure</em>, <em>manner
and time</em> of granting and raising the same.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the proprietaries of this province, in
contempt of the said royal grant, proprietary charter,
and law of their colony, designing to subvert the fundamentals
of this constitution, to deprive the assembly
and people of their rights and privileges, and to assume
an arbitrary and tyrannical power over the liberties and
properties of his majesty's liege subjects, have so restrained
their governors by the <em>despotic instructions</em>
(which are not to be varied from, and are particularly
directory in the framing and passing of money-bills and
supplies to his majesty, as to the mode, measure, and
time) that it is impossible for the assembly, should
they lose all sense of their most essential rights, and
comply with those instructions, to grant sufficient aids
for the defence of this his majesty's province from the
common enemy.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p><em>Thirdly</em>, In pursuance of sundry acts of general assembly,
approved of by the crown, [and] a natural right
inherent in every man antecedent to all laws, the assemblies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of this province have had the power of <em>disposing</em>
of the <em>public</em> monies, that have been raised for the
encouragement of trade and support of government, by
the interest money arising by the loan of the bills of
credit and the excise. No part of these monies was
ever paid by the <em>proprietaries</em>, or ever raised on their estates;
and therefore they can have no pretence of right
to a voice in the disposition of them. They have ever
been applied with prudent frugality to the honour and
advantage of the public, and the king's immediate service,
to the general approbation of the people: the credit
of the government has been preserved, and the debts
of the public punctually discharged. In short, no inconveniencies,
but great and many advantages have accrued,
from the assembly's prudent care and management
of these funds.</p>

<p>Yet the proprietaries resolved to deprive the assemblies
of the power and means of <em>supporting an agent</em>
in England, and of prosecuting their complaints and
remonstrating their aggrievances, when injured and
oppressed, to his majesty and his parliament: and to
rob them of this natural right (which has been so often
approved of by their gracious sovereign) have, by their
said instructions, prohibited their governor from giving
his assent to any laws emitting or re-emitting any paper-currency
or bills of credit, or for raising money by
excise or any other method; unless the governor or
commander in chief for the time being, by clauses to
be inserted therein, has <em>a negative in the disposition</em> of
the monies arising thereby; let the languishing circumstances
of our trade be ever so great, and a further or
greater medium be ever so necessary for its support.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>
<p class="p2" />
<p><em>Fourthly</em>, By the laws and statutes of England, the
chief rents, honours, and castles of the crown are taxed,
and <em>pay their proportion</em> to the supplies that are granted
to the king for the defence of the realm and support of
government: his majesty, the nobility of the realm,
and all the British subjects, do now actually contribute
their proportion towards the defence of America in general,
and this province in particular: and it is in a
more especial manner the duty of the <em>proprietaries</em> to
pay their proportion of a tax, for the immediate preservation
of their own estates, in this province. To exempt
therefore any part of their estates from their reasonable
part of this necessary burthen, it is unjust as it
is illegal, and as new as it is arbitrary.</p>

<p>Yet the proprietaries, notwithstanding the general
danger to which the nation and its colonies are exposed,
and great distress of this province in particular, by
their said instructions, have prohibited their governors
from passing laws for the raising supplies for its defence;
<em>unless</em> all their located, unimproved, and unoccupied
lands, quit-rents, fines, and purchase monies on
interest (the much greater part of their enormous
estates in this colony) are expressly exempted from
paying any part of the tax.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p><em>Fifthly</em>, By virtue of the said royal charter, the proprietaries
are invested with a power of doing every
thing "which unto a compleat establishment of justice,
unto courts and tribunals, forms of judicature, and
manner of proceedings, do belong." It was certainly
the import and design of this grant, that the courts of
judicature should be formed, and the <em>judges</em> and officers
thereof hold their commissions, in a manner not repugnant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
but agreeable to the laws and customs of England:
that thereby they might remain free from the
influence of persons in power, the rights of the people
might be preserved, and their properties effectually secured.
That the guarantee, William Penn (understanding
the said grant in this light) did, by his original
frame of government, covenant and grant with the
people, that the judges and other officers should hold
their commissions during their <em>good behaviour, and no
longer</em>.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding which, the governors of this province
have, for many years past, granted all the commissions
to the judges of the king's bench or supreme
court of this province, and to the judges of the court
of common pleas of the several counties, to be held
during their <em>will and pleasure</em>; by means whereof, the
said judges being subject to the influence and directions
of the proprietaries and their governors, their favourites
and creatures, the laws may not be duly administered
or executed, but often wrested from their true
sense; to serve particular purposes, the foundation of
justice may be liable to be destroyed; and the lives,
laws, liberties, privileges, and properties of the people
thereby rendered precarious and altogether insecure; to
the great disgrace of our laws, and the inconceivable
injury of his majesty's subjects.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p>Your committee further beg leave to add, that besides
these aggrievances, there are other hardships the
people of this province have experienced, that call for
redress.&mdash;The <em>inlistment of servants, without the least satisfaction</em>
being made to the masters, has not only prevented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the cultivation of our lands, and diminished the
trade and commerce of the province, but is a burthen
extremely unequal and oppressive to individuals. And
should the practice continue, the consequence must
prove very discouraging to the further settlement of
this colony, and prejudicial to his majesty's future service.&mdash;Justice,
therefore, demands, that satisfaction
should be made to the masters of such inlisted servants;
and that the right of masters to their servants be confirmed
and settled.&mdash;But as those servants have been
inlisted into his majesty's service for the general defence
of America, and not of this province only, but all the
colonies, and the nation in general, have and will receive
equal benefit from their service; this satisfaction
should be made at the expence of the nation, and not
of the province only.</p>

<p>That the people now labour under <em>a burthen of taxes</em>,
almost insupportable by so young a colony, for the defence
of its long-extended frontier, of about two hundred
miles from New Jersey to Maryland; without either of
those colonies, or the three lower counties on Delaware,
contributing their proportion thereto; though their
frontiers are in a great measure covered and protected
by our forts. And should the war continue, and with
it this unequal burthen, many of his majesty's subjects
in this province will be reduced to want, and the province,
if not lost to the enemy, involved in debt, and
sunk under its load.</p>

<p>That notwithstanding this weight of taxes, the assemblies
of this province <em>have given to the general service</em>
of the nation, five thousand pounds to purchase provisions
for the troops under General Braddock; 2,985<em>l.</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
0<em>s.</em> 11<em>d.</em> for clearing a road by his orders; 10,514<em>l.</em> 10<em>s.</em>
1<em>d.</em> to General Shirley, for the purchasing provisions
for the New England forces; and expended the sum of
2,385<em>l.</em> 0<em>s.</em> 2½<em>d.</em> in supporting the inhabitants of Nova
Scotia; which likewise we conceive ought to be a national
expence.</p>

<p>And that his majesty's subjects, the merchants and
insurers in England, as well as the merchants here and
elsewhere, did during the last, and will during the present
war, greatly suffer in their property, trade, and
commerce, by the <em>enemy's privateers</em> on this coast, and
at our capes, unless some method be fallen on to prevent
it.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p>Wherefore your committee are of opinion, That the
commissioners intended to be sent to England<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, to solicit
a memorial and redress of the many infractions and
violations of the constitution; should also have it in
charge, and be instructed to represent to our most gracious
sovereign and his parliaments, the several unequal
burthens and hardships before-mentioned;&mdash;and endeavour
to procure satisfaction to the masters of such
servants as have been inlisted, and the right of
masters to their servants established and confirmed;&mdash;and
obtain a repayment of the said several sums of
money, some assistance towards defending our extensive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>

three sorts. First, <em>provincial</em> governments; where the constitution originally
depends on the king's commission, and instructions given to his governors;
and the assemblies, held under that authority, have their share in
making local ordinances not repugnant to English law. Next, <em>proprietary</em>
governments; where a district of country is given by the crown to individuals,
attended with certain legislative powers in the nature of a fief; with
a provision for the sovereignty at home, and also for the fulfilment of the
terms and end of the grant. Lastly, <em>charter</em> governments, where the fundamentals
of the government are previously prescribed and made known
to the settlers, being in no degree left subject to a governor's commission
or proprietor's will. (See Blackstone, Vol. I. Introd. § 4.)&mdash;Good faith
however to mankind seemed to require, that the constitutions, once begun
under the provincial or proprietary governments, should remain unaltered
(except for improvement) to the respective settlers, equally as in charter-governments.

<p class="pfs70 lsp2">DEDICATION.</p>

<p class="center">To the right honourable Arthur Onslow, speaker of the
honourable House of Commons.</p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>The subject of the following sheets is an unhappy
one: the controversy between the proprietaries and
successive assemblies of Pensylvania: a controversy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
which has often embarrassed, if not endangered the
public service: a controversy which has been long depending,
and which still seems to be as far from an
issue as ever.</p>

<p>Our blessed saviour reproaches the Pharisees with
laying heavy burdens on men's shoulders, which they
themselves would not stir with a single finger.</p>

<p>Our proprietaries, sir, have done the same; and, for
the sake of the commonwealth, the province has
hitherto submitted to the imposition: not indeed, without
the most strenuous endeavours to lay the load
equally, the fullest manifestations, and the strongest
protestations against the violence put upon them.</p>

<p>Having been most injuriously misrepresented and
traduced in print, by the known agents and dependents
of those gentlemen their fellow subjects, they at last
find themselves obliged to set forth an historical state
of their case, and to make their appeal to the public
upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>With the public opinion in their favour, they may
with the more confidence lift up their eyes to the wisdom
of parliament and the majesty of the crown, from
whence alone they can derive an effectual remedy.</p>

<p>To your hands, sir, these papers are most humbly
presented, for considerations so obvious, that they scarce
need any explanation.</p>

<p>The Roman provinces did not stand more in need of
patronage than ours: and such clients as we are would
have preferred the integrity of Cato to the fortune of
Cæsar.</p>

<p>The cause we bring is in fact the cause of all the provinces
in one: it is the cause of every British subject
in every part of the British dominions: it is the cause
of every man who deserves to be free every where.</p>

<p>The propriety, therefore, of addressing these papers
to a gentleman, who, for so many successive parliaments,
with so much honour to himself and satisfaction
to the public, has been at the head of the commons of
Great Britain, cannot be called in question.</p>

<p>You will smile, sir, perhaps, as you read the references
of a provincial assembly to the rights and claims of
parliament; but we humbly conceive, it will be without
the least mixture of resentment; those assemblies having
nothing more in view, than barely to establish their
privileges on the most rational and solid basis they
could find, for the security and service of their constituents.</p>

<p>And you are humbly besought, sir, not to think the
worse of this address, because it has been made without
your permission or privity.</p>

<p>Nobody asks leave to pay a debt: every Briton is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
your debtor, sir: and all we have said, or can say, is but
a poor composition for what we owe you.</p>

<p>You have conferred as much honour on the chair you
fill, as the chair has conferred on you.</p>

<p>Probity and dignity are your characteristics.</p>

<p>May that seat always derive the same lustre from the
same qualities!</p>

<p>This at least ought to be our prayer, whether it is or
not within our expectations.</p>

<p>For the province of Pensylvania, as well as in my
own private capacity, I have the honour to be, with the
most profound respect,</p>

<p class="right padr8">Sir,</p>

<p class="right padr4">your most obedient humble servant,</p>

<p class="smcap right padr2">the Editor.</p>

<hr class="r20" />
<p class="pfs70 lsp2">INTRODUCTION.</p>

<p>To obtain an infinite variety of purposes by a few
plain principles is the characteristic of nature. As the
eye is affected so is the understanding: objects at distance
strike it according to their dimensions, or the
quantity of light thrown upon them; near, according to
their novelty or familiarity as they are in motion or at
rest. It is the same with actions. A battle is all motion;
a hero all glare: while such images are before us,
we can attend to nothing else. Solon and Lycurgus
would make no figure in the same scene with the king
of Prussia; and we are at present so lost in a military
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
scramble on the continent next us, in which it must be
confessed we are deeply interested, that we have scarce
time to throw a glance towards America, where we have
also much at stake, and where, if any where, our account
must be made up at last.</p>

<p>We love to stare more than to reflect, and to be indolently
amused at our leisure, than to commit the
smallest trespass on our patience by winding a painful
tedious maze, which would pay us in nothing but knowledge.</p>

<p>But then as there are some eyes that can find nothing
marvellous but what is marvellously great, so there are
others equally disposed to marvel at what is marvellously
little; and who can derive as much entertainment
from this microscope in examining a mite, as
Dr. &mdash;&mdash; in ascertaining the geography of the moon,
or measuring the tail of a comet.</p>

<p>Let this serve as an excuse for the author of these
sheets, if he needs any, for bestowing them on the
transactions of a colony, till of late hardly mentioned in
our annals; in point of establishment one of the last
upon the British list, and in point of rank one of the
most subordinate, as being not only subject, in common
with the rest, to the crown, but also to the claims of a
<em>proprietary</em>, who thinks he does them <em>honour</em> enough in
governing them by <em>deputy</em>; consequently so much further
removed from the royal eye, and so much the more
exposed to the pressure of self-interested <em>instructions</em>.</p>

<p>Considerable, however, as most of them, for happiness
of situation, fertility of soil, product of valuable
commodities, number of inhabitants, shipping, amount of
exportations, latitude of rights and privileges, and every
other requisite for the being and well-being of society,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and more considerable than any of them all for the celerity
of its growth, unassisted by any human help but
the vigour and virtue of its own excellent constitution.</p>

<p>A father and his family, the latter united by interest
and affection, the former to be revered for the wisdom
of his institutions and the indulgent use of his authority,
was the form it was at first presented in. Those who
were only ambitious of repose found it here; and as
none returned with an evil report of the land, numbers
followed: all partook of the leaven they found: the
community still wore the same equal face: nobody
aspired: nobody was oppressed: industry was sure of
profit, knowledge of esteem, and virtue of veneration.</p>

<p>An assuming <em>landlord</em>, strongly disposed to convert
free tenants into abject vassals, and to reap what he
did not sow, countenanced and abetted by a few desperate
and designing dependents, on the one side; and on
the other, all who have sense enough to know their
rights, and spirit enough to defend them, combined as
one man against the said landlord and his encroachment
in the form it has since assumed.</p>

<p>And surely a nation born to liberty like this, bound
to leave it unimpaired as they received it from their fathers
in perpetuity to their heirs, and interested in the
conservation of it in every appendix to the British empire,
the particulars of such a contest cannot be wholly
indifferent.</p>

<p>On the contrary, it is reasonable to think, the first
workings of power against liberty, and the natural efforts
of unbiassed men to secure themselves against the
first approaches of oppression, must have a captivating
power over every man of sensibility and discernment
amongst us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Liberty it seems thrives best in the woods. America
best cultivates what Germany brought forth. And
were it not for certain ugly comparisons, hard to be
suppressed, the pleasure arising from such a research
would be without alloy.</p>

<p>In the feuds of Florence recorded by Machiavel, we
find more to lament and less to praise. Scarce can we
believe the first citizens of the ancient republics had
such pretensions to consideration, though so highly celebrated
in ancient story. As to ourselves, we need no
longer have recourse to the late glorious stand of the
French parliament to excite our emulation.</p>

<p>It is a known custom among farmers, to change their
corn from season to season, for the sake of filling the
bushel: and in case the wisdom of the age should condescend
to make the like experiment in another shape,
from hence we may learn, whither to repair for the proper
species.</p>

<p>It is not however to be presumed, that such as have
long been accustomed to consider the colonies in general
as only so many dependencies on the council board,
the board of trade, and the board of customs; or, as a
hot-bed for causes, jobs and other pecuniary emoluments,
and as formed as effectually by <em>instructions</em> as
by <em>laws</em>, can be prevailed on to consider those patriot
rustics with any degree of respect.</p>

<p>But how contemptibly soever these gentlemen may
talk of the colonies, how cheap soever they may hold
their assemblies, or how insignificant the planters and
traders who compose them, truth will be truth, and
principle, principle, notwithstanding.</p>

<p>Courage, wisdom, integrity, and honour are not to
be measured by the place assigned them to act in, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
by the trials they undergo and the vouchers they furnish:
and if so manifested, need neither robes or titles
to set them off.</p>

in 1693, and administered by colonel Fletcher, governor

and that of their majesties, to be directly opposite
to each other.</p>

<p>He menaces the assembly with an annexion of their
province to that of New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Protestation against passing of bills, amended by the
governor and council, without the previous assent of the
assembly to those amendments, and of money-bills before
grievances have been redressed.</p>

<p>Remonstrance to Mr. Penn concerning this period.</p>

<p>The governor admits the principles of the quakers,
not to carry arms, or levy money to make war; and solicits
a supply to feed the hungry and clothe the naked
(Indians).</p>

<p>The assembly insist on their right to appropriate as
well as to raise money.</p>

<p>The government of William Markham, Esq.</p>

<p>A new act of settlement or frame of government.</p>

<p>The government resumed by Mr. Penn.</p>

<p>The province purged from the odium of favouring
pirates, and carrying on an illicit trade.</p>

<p>The assembly formed thereon dissolved.</p>

<p>Another assembly called upon another model, to meet
at Newcastle instead of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Aids granted for the proprietary-governor, in exchange
for a conformation of property.</p>

<p>An aid of 350<em>l.</em> sterling to the crown on this account.</p>

answers and their replies.</p>

<p>A breach between the province and the territory.</p>

charter, is <em>now</em> the rule of government.</p>

<p>It is unanimously rejected by the freemen of the territory.</p>

<p>Mr. Penn's departure for England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Andrew Hamilton, Esq. deputy-governor, in vain endeavours
to unite the territory with the province.</p>

<p>John Evans, Esq. succeeds Hamilton, and makes the
like endeavour, also in vain.</p>

<p>Controversy between him and the assembly concerning
the bill to confirm the charter.</p>

<p>Nine several heads of complaint entered in the minutes
of the assembly, as the ground of a representation
to the proprietary; being the representation several
times before cited.</p>

<p>The remainder of that representation.</p>

<p>A copy of it demanded by the governor and refused
by the assembly.</p>

<p>The latter make a merit of having forborne to make
their representation public.</p>

and Logan, secretary to the governor and council.</p>

<p>An unanimous vote of thanks to the proprietary for
recalling Evans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>General view of Gookin's government.</p>

<p>Assembly's character of themselves.</p>

<p>A proprietary-governor a wretched thing.</p>

<p>Artful conduct of governor Keith.</p>

<p>Mr. Penn's death.</p>

<p>The province left in the hands of trustees.</p>

<p>Logan, one of those trustees, obtains a majority in the
council against the governor.</p>

<p>Logan makes a voyage to England, and returns with
private instructions to Keith, which Keith communicates
to the assembly.</p>

<p>The governor and assembly in concert pay no regard
to the said instructions.</p>

<p>A controversy in print, between the governor and
Logan thereon.</p>

<p>A breach between the governor and speaker.</p>

<p>The province in a state of tranquillity for nine years
under his administration.</p>

<p>A pathetic reflection on the melancholy case of governors
recalled.</p>

<p>Pensylvania easy to be governed, if well governed.</p>

<p>Private instructions from the proprietary in two several
instances declared void.</p>

<p>The proprietary of Pensylvania too inconsiderable
here at home to be a patron to the province, and too
unsizeably great there.</p>

<p>The proprietaries the sole purchasers of Indian lands:&mdash;the
people at the sole expence of Indian affairs:&mdash;treaties
and purchases concomitant.</p>

<p>The quit-rents of Pensylvania, paid to the proprietary,
first demanded and granted to defray the charge of government.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding which the people now pay taxes for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
that purpose, and the proprietaries insist on holding
their estates tax-free.</p>

<p>Paper-money first issued in Pensylvania.</p>

<p>Precautions taken to secure it from depreciation.</p>

<p>Mr. Penn's trustees averse to the said issue, till a provision
was made, at the expence of the province, to render
his heirs gainers by it.</p>

<p>Room left in the constitution of the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'provice for'">province for</ins> self
defence by force of arms, though the use of arms was
not consistent with the principles of quakers.</p>

<p>In consequence of complaints to parliament, of the
mischiefs arising from excessive issues of paper-money
by the eastern governments (that is to say those of New
England) a general instruction was sent to <em>all</em> the governors
of North America, not to give their assent to
any farther bills of that nature, without a suspending
clause, till his majesty's pleasure should be known.</p>

<p>The assembly grants money in aid of the expedition
against Carthagena.</p>

<p>The governor inlists indented servants upon that occasion;
and the assembly apply the money they had
given to indemnify the masters.</p>

<p>They give 3,000<em>l.</em> towards the public service, to be
applied as his majesty should direct.</p>

<p>Also another sum of 4,000<em>l.</em> to furnish necessaries to
the troops in Louisburgh.</p>

<p>And yet another sum of 5,000<em>l.</em> towards the intended
expedition against Canada in the year 1746, by an addition
of the like sum to their paper currency, and notwithstanding
the above instruction, the governor gave
his assent to the bill for that purpose.</p>

<p>The proprietaries of Pensylvania oppose the bill
brought into parliament for restraining the northern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
colonies from issuing paper bills of credit, and make a
merit of it in the province.</p>

<p>The assembly call upon the proprietaries to contribute
to the expence of Indian affairs, which they decline.</p>

<p>The assembly's representation thereon.</p>

<p>A bill for increasing the provincial paper-currency in
proportion to the increase of the province, by an addition
of 20,000<em>l.</em> thereto.</p>

<p>Rejected by the governor for being unseasonably
timed.</p>

<p>And petitioned by the inhabitants.</p>

<p>A message from the governor (Hamilton) preparing
the house to expect incursions from the French among
the Indians in alliance with them, and requiring assistance
on their behalf.</p>

<p>The answer of the proprietaries to the representation
of the assembly concerning the expence of Indian
affairs.</p>

<p>The assembly's message sent to the governor, together
with the currency-bill he had before rejected.</p>

<p>Another message to him concerning Indian affairs,
and notifying a present of condolence to the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Twightwee'">Twigtwee</ins>
tribe.</p>

<p>Governor's message, importing his assent to the currency-bill,
with a suspending clause.</p>

<p>Resolution of the assembly not to accept this clause,
with their reasons.</p>

<p>A note of regret, that some temperament had not
been found out at home, to prevent the controversy,
which was now on the point of breaking out.</p>

<p>Remonstrance of the assembly against the said clause.</p>

<p>The governor's message of adherence thereto.</p>

<p>The assembly's reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Their reply to the proprietary's answer to the representation
on Indian expences.</p>

<p>Unanimous resolution of the assembly concerning the
necessity of a remission of their paper-currency.</p>

<p>Lord Holdernesse's letter and other papers laid before
them, together with a written message from the
governor thereon.</p>

<p>The assembly's answer, accompanied with their currency-bill.</p>

<p>The governor rejects it; but offers to pass a bill for
striking a farther sum on a proper fund for sinking the
same in a few years.</p>

<p>The assembly prudently avail themselves of the cautions
in lord Holdernesse's letter concerning <em>undoubted
limits</em>, to decline taking any part in the broil, till the
government of Virginia, as first concerned, should set
the first example.</p>

<p>The governor revives the old controversy concerning
the paper-money instruction.</p>

<p>Declares in another paper he had <em>undoubted assurance</em>,
that part of his majesty's dominions <em>within</em> his government
was at that time invaded, and demands supplies
to arm the province, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The assembly demur, and desire a short adjournment.</p>

<p>The governor not only persists in his former declaration,
but maintains, that the case was the same, whether
the invasion of the enemy was made in Virginia or
Pensylvania.</p>

<p>The assembly adjourn to May 6, and are assembled
by the governor April 2, in order to lay before them
papers from governor Dinwiddie; and demand a supply.</p>

<p>Debates in the assembly on the <em>quantum</em>, and a new
adjournment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Another session, and a message from the governor,
accompanied with intelligence, that the French were
before the fort built by the Virginians on the Ohio;
with dispatches and a proposition from the governors
of Boston and New York, for an union of the colonies,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>A joint bill for granting an aid of 10,000<em>l.</em> to the king,
and 20,000<em>l.</em> for replacing torn and ragged bills, offered.</p>

<p>Amendments proposed by the governor.</p>

<p>Unanimously rejected by the assembly, and for what
reasons.</p>

<p>The governor's reply.</p>

<p>A reflection thereon.</p>

<p>Resolutions of the assembly.</p>

<p>And message to the governor before their adjournment.</p>

<p>They are re-convened by special summons on the
occasion of Washington's defeat, and required to form
chearful and vigorous resolutions for dislodging the
enemy, in concurrence with Virginia.</p>

<p>The proceedings of the commissioners at Albany laid
before them.</p>

<p>They prepare and present a bill for striking 35,000<em>l.</em>
in bills of credit, and the rest for replacing defective bills.</p>

<p>Which the governor evades for want of sufficient
powers to pass it.</p>

<p>Governor Morris's arrival at Philadelphia, and first
speech to a new assembly.</p>

<p>The assembly's answer and adjournment.</p>

<p>Being assembled again, a letter from Sir Thomas
Robinson, secretary of state, is laid before them; and
the governor in his speech requires them to raise and
keep up a considerable body of troops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>They present a bill for raising 40,000<em>l.</em> on the former
plan; half of this sum for the public service; with a
message, expressing their concern at a paragraph in the
secretary of state's letter, by which it appeared their
conduct had not been fairly represented at home.</p>

<p>The old instruction, and an opinion of the attorney-general's,
pleaded by the governor in bar of his assent,
unless the money was raised in a five-years fund.</p>

<p>A letter from Sir Thomas Robinson to the governor
of Pensylvania, dispatched at the same time with others
of similar tendency to the other governors of the northern
colonies.</p>

<p>Which the governor, in his comment upon it, endeavours
to narrow the application of, to Pensylvania only.</p>

<p>A message from the assembly, fully demonstrating,
that Pensylvania was not comprehended in the instruction
insisted upon; and that in case it was, the present
emergency was one of those, which, according to the
very letter of that instruction, might be provided for
notwithstanding: also desiring a sight of the instructions
he himself had received from his principals.</p>

<p>A second message, in which they call upon the governor
to give his assent to the bill, as what would answer
all the purposes recommended to them in Sir
Thomas Robinson's letter.</p>

<p>The governor's reply, declining the bill as before;
because the supply might be otherwise raised, and
evading the communication of his instructions.</p>

<p>The assembly's rejoinder, justifying the requisition
they made of his instructions; and intimating, that an
appeal to the crown was the only method left them of
being continued <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'in theuse'">in the use</ins> and benefit of their birthright,
and charter liberties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>The governor questions their right to have these instructions
laid before them, and endeavours to put them
beside their point, by magnifying the preparations of
the French, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The assembly order the papers which had passed
between the proprietaries and them to be printed,
which till then they had avoided.</p>

<p>Their unanimous resolutions concerning the proprietary
instructions, in which they declare it as their opinion,
that the said instructions were the principal if not
the sole obstruction to their bill: also the most essential
points contained in their reply to the governor's
charges against them.</p>

<p>A brief of the governor's sur-rejoinder.</p>

<p>Some general remarks.</p>

<p>The assembly make their appeal to the crown, inform
the governor thereof, signify their inclination to adjourn
till May, and give his instructions the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de
grace</i>.</p>

<p>The governor's expostulatory message thereon.</p>

<p>He demands a copy of their minutes; they order
him one when the printed copies were <em>finished</em>, and
adjourn.</p>

<p>Upon Braddock's arrival in Virginia, they are re-assembled
by special summons: the demands made by
message on that occasion.</p>

<p>The governor reprimands them for having published
Sir Thomas Robinson's letter in their minutes, and for
not delivering him a copy of those minutes so soon as
he had required them.</p>

<p>The assembly's answer thereto.</p>

<p>Orders and counter-orders to the printer of these
minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Two messages from the governor; one communicating
a design of general Shirley to build a fort <em>within
the limits</em> of his majesty's territories near <em>Crown Point</em>,
to which the assembly is required to contribute; and
the other, notifying first the arrival of Braddock's
forces, and then the expectations entertained at home,
that the colonies would raise an additional number of
forces, furnish provisions, &amp;c. all terminated with a
kind of menace of the resentment of his majesty and
the parliament, in case of a disappointment.</p>

<p><em>Twenty five thousand pounds</em> granted to the king's use,
to be raised by an emission of paper-bills to the same
amount, and to be sunk by an extension of the excise
for ten years.</p>

<p>Refused by the governor, on the old pretence of a
contrary instruction.</p>

<p>A provision demanded for the expence of an Indian
treaty.</p>

<p>A memorial to the assembly from Mr. Quincy, a
commissioner from the government of Massachusett's
Bay, expressing both his concern, that the governor
could not be induced to pass the said money-bill, and
his acknowledgments of the <em>chearfulness</em> shown by
them in granting 10,000<em>l.</em> for victualling the forces to
be employed in New England; being part of the money
so granted; and urging them to find out some
other means of rendering their purpose effectual.</p>

<p>The assembly resolve to raise the said sum on the
credit of the province.</p>

<p>Another paper of acknowledgment from the said
Mr. Quincy.</p>

<p>The governor refuses to return the said bill to the
assembly; informs them the French had fitted out fifteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
sail of the line, with six thousand land forces, and
calls upon them to put the province into a state of defence,
as the enemy could not be ignorant how plentiful
and defenceless it was; yet advises a short adjournment.</p>

<p>They meet again, and a squabble arising between them
about a bill merely provincial, he revives the former
controversy.</p>

<p>The assembly's spirited answer to this captious message.</p>

<p>A remark thereon.</p>

<p>They are re-assembled.</p>

<p>A hardy assertion, concerning the paper-money act
passed by governor Thomas, refuted by a fact.</p>

<p>An acknowledgment from the officers of the regular
forces of certain presents made to them by the assembly.</p>

<p>The governor's message to the assembly, said to be
founded on a representation of general Braddock's, requiring
them to enable him to furnish the said general
with provisions under proper convoys, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>The assembly desire to have the general's letter laid
before them, which the governor declines, and thereby
occasions a new controversy.</p>

<p>The assembly send up two other bills; one of 10,000<em>l.</em>
for exchanging old bills, and one of 15,000<em>l.</em> for the
king's use, on the model of that formerly passed by governor
Thomas, and confirmed at home by the royal
authority, since the instruction so often cited had been
sent to the said governor.</p>

<p>Such amendments offered to it by the governor, as
he could not but be pre-convinced would not be
allowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>The assembly adjourn till September; but are again
convoked in July, on occasion of Braddock's defeat.</p>

<p>The governor's speech.</p>

<p>The assembly vote an aid of 50,000<em>l.</em> by a tax on all
real and personal estates.</p>

<p>The governor makes a pompous offer in the proprietary's
name, of certain lands west of Allegheny mountains,
to such adventurers as would fight for them, and
calls upon the assembly to afford some assistance to
such as should accept the same.</p>

<p>A remonstrance which certain inhabitants of certain
places were induced to present to the assembly.</p>

<p>The address of the assembly to the governor.</p>

<p>Their 50,000<em>l.</em> money-bill returned, with an amendment,
by which the <span class="xs lsp2">WHOLE</span> <em>proprietary estate</em> was to be
<em>exempted</em> from tax.</p>

<p>The message of the assembly to the governor on that
occasion, desiring his reasons for that exemption.</p>

<p>The governor's reply, containing four curious reasons.</p>

<p>The assembly's rejoinder, refuting those reasons.</p>

<p>Other papers which passed between them at the
same crisis.</p>

<p>The residue of Braddock's troops being recalled from
the frontiers, notwithstanding an application of the assembly
to the governor requesting their continuance,
he calls upon the house to provide for the security of
the Back-inhabitants.</p>

<p>A remark thereon.</p>

<p>The governor alarms and embarrasses them with petitions
from certain persons requiring to be armed; <em>intelligence</em>
of Indians actually set out, to fall upon their
frontiers; recommendations to provide by law against
exporting provisions to the enemy, as a requisite to facilitate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the reduction of Louisburgh; and <em>demands</em> of all
manner of <em>things</em> for the assistance of colonel Dunbar,
who, by orders from general Shirley, was again to proceed
towards Fort Duquesne.</p>

<p>A proposal from certain gentlemen of Philadelphia
to subscribe 500<em>l.</em> in lieu of the proprietary proportion
of the tax in question, and upon a presumption that the
proprietaries would honourably reimburse them.</p>

<p>The assembly send up their bill to the governor
again, together with the said proposal, as containing
by implication an acknowledgment that the tax was
founded in equity, and also a farther security to the governor,
in case he should give his assent to the bill.</p>

<p>Their message to the governor, correcting his manner
of stating the Louisburgh point, and observing,
that all required of them from New England was to
prolong the excellent laws they had already made.</p>

<p>Some seasonable remarks.</p>

<p>The governor's verbal answer to the assembly's
message concerning the money-bill, adhering to his
amendment.</p>

<p>He contends for a militia.</p>

<p>The assembly order 1,000<em>l.</em> if so much remain in
their treasury, to arm the Back-inhabitants.</p>

<p>They signify their purpose to adjourn, and refer the
affair of a militia-bill to a new assembly.</p>

<p>Their proceedings at the next meeting: the governor
demands an additional supply of provision to be sent to
Albany, at the requisition of governor Phipps, for the
use of the forces of Massachusett's Bay: and another
supply for the provisional troops of Connecticut and
Rhode Island, which he was <em>informed</em> were raised in addition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to those already employed in the reduction of
Crown-Point.</p>

<p>The assembly apply for a sight of Phipps's letter,
which is refused.</p>

<p>The old controversy renewed.</p>

<p>A new one concerning the roads opened at the expence
of the province for the convenience of the king's
forces, which is carried on with much acrimony on
both sides.</p>

<p>As a last effort for the public service the assembly
authorize by vote a loan, or voluntary subscription, of
10,000<em>l.</em> to be raised in a fortnight, and refer the lenders
to the next assembly for payment.</p>

<p>An apology for the length of this treatise; and a
brief state of the province at this period.</p>

<p>The new assembly, after a session of four days, suffered
to adjourn themselves without proceeding to business,
for want of having the intelligence then in the
governor's hands in due form imparted to them.</p>

<p>Being re-convoked, the governor informs them, that
a party of French and Indians had passed the mountains,
and were encamped within eight miles of the capital,
and, after a liberal intermixture of upbraidings
and self-sufficiencies, demands a supply; premising,
that it might be raised by an emission of any sum in
paper, provided funds were found for sinking it in five
years, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A reference to the only act of parliament extant, and
that an ineffectual one, to prevent the oppressions practised
by provincial governors.</p>

<p>Politics of various kinds, and from various quarters,
presented to the assembly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The assembly reduce and rectify the matter of alarm
communicated by the governor; and advise such measures
as might reclaim the Indians, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A new message concerning the depredations of the
Indians.</p>

<p><em>Sixty thousand pounds</em> granted, to be struck in bills of
credit, which were to be sunk by a tax of <em>six-pence</em> in
the pound; and a <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'poll-tax of sen'">poll-tax of <em>ten</em></ins><em> shillings</em> a head, yearly,
for four years; which the governor refuses, and talks
of <em>setting off</em> for the back counties.</p>

<p>A new message, reporting, that the Susquehanna Indians
had offered their service to the province, provided
it was accepted without delay.</p>

<p>Two messages from the assembly to the governor;
the first concerning peace with the Indians, and the
money bill; the other an answer to his concerning the
Susquehanna Indians.</p>

<p>They send up a bill for regulating the Indian trade.</p>

<p>The famous Kentish petition to the house of commons,
in 1701, outdone by the mayor of Philadelphia,
and one hundred and thirty three other inconsiderates,
in a demand on their assembly to constitute a militia
forthwith.</p>

<p>A petition of certain of the people called Quakers,
for peaceable measures.</p>

<p>Progress of the controversy concerning the bill,
which the governor offers to pass with a suspending
clause.</p>

<p>Resolutions of the assembly hereupon.</p>

<p>Message from the governor concerning another Indian
massacre, and demanding an immediate supply,
&amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Another from the assembly to him, justifying their
bill both in matter and manner.</p>

<p>They send him up a militia bill.</p>

<p>The governor's invective against their whole conduct.</p>

<p>He passes the militia bill, under the specific declaration
that it was an improper one.</p>

<p>He communicates to the assembly a discussion of
Indian affairs, as prepared by his council; calls upon
them to provide for a swarm of French banished out of
Nova Scotia; and signifies, that the proprietaries had
sent an order upon their receiver-general, for 5000<em>l.</em> as
a free gift to the public.</p>

<p>Another remonstrance from the mayor of Philadelphia
and his posse.</p>

<p>The assembly's reply to the governor's invective,
which for the present they declined making use of.</p>

<p>The answer they did make use of.</p>

<p>Parley between the speaker and twenty-nine petitioners,
or rather prescribers to the assembly.</p>

<p>Unanimous resolutions concerning the right of granting
supplies to the crown; and a new money bill, out
of which the proprietary estate was excepted, in consideration
of the late grant of 5000<em>l.</em></p>

<p>The assembly's message to the governor, explaining
the use and pressing the dispatch of the Indian trade
bill.</p>

<p>The governor's evasive answer.</p>

<p>His message desiring the advice of the house.</p>

<p>The assembly's answer.</p>

<p>Their message relative to the complaint of the Shawanese
Indians.</p>

purchased servants.</p>

<p>General Shirley's letter of acknowledgment for a
voluntary present of clothing sent by the province to
his troops.</p>

<p>The assembly remind the governor of the Indian
trade bill.</p>

<p>He returns it with amendments; as also their bill for
extending the excise.</p>

<p>They adhere to their bills and assign their reasons.</p>

<p>The governor goes to Newcastle and the assembly
adjourn.</p>

<p>Sir William Johnson's treaty with the six nations laid
before them at their next meeting.</p>

<p>The governor appearing strongly inclined to involve
the province in a war with the Delawares and Shawanese,
some of the people called Quakers petition for
specific measures.</p>

<p>The governor on the other hand alarms the house
with an account of a number of people coming in a
body to make <em>demands</em> upon them.</p>

<p>Their unanimity on that occasion.</p>

<p>The governor takes advantage of this incident to
declare war against the said two Indian nations.</p>

<p>He also demands farther supplies, and intimates, that
certain Indians, long subsisted by the province, were
retiring in discontent, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The assembly's answer.</p>

<p>The return made by the governor.</p>

<p>The resolutions of the assembly concerning a plan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of military operations communicated to them by the
governor.</p>

<p>They adjourn and are re-assembled.</p>

<p>The governor's message to them from a place called
<em>Harris's Ferry</em>.</p>

<p>A petition of the association companies in Philadelphia,
concerning the insufficiency of the militia law.</p>

<p>The reply of the assembly to the governor's message,
accompanied with a bill for prohibiting provisions.</p>

governor, who was still posted at Harris's Ferry.</p>

<p>A money bill ordered, but postponed on the receipt
of intelligence from Sir Charles Hardy and Sir William
Johnson, that the Delawares and Shawanese were disposed
to renew their alliance.</p>

<p>The governor proclaims a suspension of arms.</p>

Lord Loudoun to be commander in chief in America;
as also the act of parliament for raising a regiment of
foreigners; recommending particularly, that the masters
of such indented servants as should engage in the

of an act passed in the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Lower Countries'">Lower Counties</ins>, the
Pensylvanian act, lately passed, would expire also, they

would prepare a proper bill for continuing the embargo,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The governor's answer.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p><span class="smcap">An Appendix</span>, containing sundry original papers
relative to the several points in controversy between
the governors and assemblies of Pensylvania, viz.</p>

<p>1. The representation of the assembly to the proprietaries,
requesting them to bear a proportionable
part of Indian expences.</p>

<p>2. The proprietaries' answer; and assembly's remarks
thereon.</p>

<p>3. A message from governor Morris, containing his
additional arguments to show the <em>unreasonableness</em> of
taxing the proprietary estate for its defence, and in support
of the restrictions he was under in that respect.</p>

<p>4. The assembly's answer thereto.</p>

<p>5. The governor's reply.</p>

<p>6. The assembly's rejoinder.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="negidt1">[Note. <em>In the above four messages great part of the
points in dispute between the proprietaries and people of
the province are fully litigated; and the perusal of them
is necessary to those who would have a thorough knowledge
of the controversy.</em>]</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p>7. The speaker of the Pensylvanian assembly's paper
of authorities relating to the rights of the commons
over money-bills, and in support of the 50,000<em>l.</em> bills
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
passed by the assembly, so far as it relates to the taxing
the proprietary estate within that province.</p>

<p>8. Report of a committee of assembly on the proprietary
<em>instructions</em> relative to <em>money-bills</em>; clearly demonstrating,
that though the proprietaries would at
length appear to be willing to have their estates taxed
in common with other estates, yet that were laws passed
pursuant to these instructions, much the greatest
part of their estate would be exempted, and that the
sums necessary to be granted for his majesty's service
in that province could not possibly be raised thereby,
&amp;c. &amp;c. <em>A paper of importance.</em></p>

<p>9. Mr. Thomas Penn's estimate of the <em>value</em> of the
proprietary estate in Pensylvania, upwards of twenty
years ago; with remarks thereon, showing its prodigious
increase since that time, the profits arising to the
<span class="smcap">House of Penn</span> from their Indian purchases, and the
huckstering manner in which they dispose of lands to
the king's subjects in that province.</p>

<p>10. A specimen of the anonymous abuses continually
published against the inhabitants of Pensylvania, by
the proprietaries and their agents, with Mr. W. Franklin's
refutation thereof.</p>

<p>11. Some remarks on the conduct of the last and
present governor, with regard to their employing the
provincial forces as <em>regulars</em>, rather than as <em>rangers</em>; and
showing the secret reason why that province is at present
without a <em>militia-law</em>, notwithstanding the several
bills which have been lately passed by the assembly for
that purpose.</p>

<p>12. An account of sundry sums of money paid by the
province for his majesty's service, <em>since the commencement
of the present troubles in America</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>13. An extract from an original letter of Mr. Logan,
containing, among other things, his opinion of the proprietary
right to the government of the three Delaware
counties; and which serves to account for the particular
favour shown that government from time to
time.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> This is the title of an octavo volume, consisting of nearly five hundred
pages closely printed. It was written, as mentioned in the preceding note,
while Dr. Franklin was in England as agent for the province of Pensylvania,
to further the ends of his mission, by removing the unfavourable impressions
which had taken place to the prejudice of the Pensylvanians:
and "it must be confessed," as a reviewer of the work observes, "they
had in <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'our anthor'">our author</ins> a most zealous and able advocate. His sentiments are
manly, liberal, and spirited; his style close, nervous, and rhetorical. By
a forcible display of the oppressions his clients have sustained, he inclines
us to pity their condition; by an enumeration of their virtues he endeavours
to remove the idea, which many have entertained, of their unimportance,
and, abstracted from their consideration in a political light, they
claim our regard by reason of their own personal merits." Interesting
however as the controversy between the governors and the assembly of
Pensylvania may have been at the time, it is too little so now to justify the
insertion of so voluminous an account of it in the present collection, and
we shall content ourselves therefore with extracting the dedication, preface,
and contents. It is singular, that neither the editor of Dr. Franklin's
works, whom we have designated by the letters B.&nbsp;V.; nor Dr.
<ins class="corr" title="Errata applied: 'for Cruger read Stuber'">Stuber</ins>, the continuator of his life, should have mentioned this publication.
The work is indeed anonymous, but it is so well known to have been Dr.
Franklin's, that in the common library catalogue of the British Museum
it is ranked under his name. <em>Editor.</em></p></div></div>

<p>I have perused with no small pleasure the Letter
addressed to Two Great Men, and the Remarks on that
letter. It is not merely from the beauty, the force and
perspicuity of expression, or the general elegance of
manner conspicuous in both pamphlets, that my pleasure
chiefly arises; it is rather from this, that I have
lived to see subjects of the greatest importance to this
nation publicly discussed without party views, or party
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
heat, with decency and politeness, and with no other
warmth, than what a zeal for the honour and happiness
of our king and country <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'msy inspire'">may inspire</ins>; and this by writers,
whose understanding (however they may differ
from each other) appears not unequal to their candour
and the uprightness of their intention.</p>

<p>But, as great abilities have not always the best information,
there are, I apprehend, in the Remarks,
some opinions not well founded, and some mistakes of
so important a nature, as to render a few observations
on them necessary for the better information of the
public.</p>

<p>The author of the Letter, who must be every way
best able to support his own sentiments, will, I hope,
excuse me, if I seem officiously to interfere; when he
considers, that the spirit of patriotism, like other qualities
good and bad, is catching; and that his long silence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
since the Remarks appeared has made us despair
of seeing the subject farther discussed by his masterly
hand. The ingenious and candid remarker, too, who
must have been misled himself before he employed
his skill and address to mislead others, will certainly,
since he declares he <em>aims at no seduction</em><a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>, be disposed
to excuse even the weakest effort to prevent it.</p>

<p>And surely, if the general opinions that possess the
minds of the people may possibly be of consequence in
public affairs, it must be fit to set those opinions right.
If there is danger, as the remarker supposes, that
"extravagant expectations" may embarrass "a virtuous
and able ministry," and "render the negotiation for
peace a work of infinite difficulty<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>;" there is no less
danger that expectations too low, through want of proper
information, may have a contrary effect, may make
even a virtuous and able ministry less anxious, and less
attentive to the obtaining points, in which the honour
and interest of the nation are essentially concerned;
and the people less hearty in supporting such a ministry
and its measures.</p>

<p>The people of this nation are indeed respectable,
not for their numbers only, but for their understanding
and their public spirit: they manifest the first, by their
universal approbation of the late prudent and vigorous
measures, and the confidence they so justly repose in a
wise and good prince, and an honest and able administration;
the latter they have demonstrated by the immense
supplies granted in parliament unanimously, and
paid through the whole kingdom with chearfulness.
And since to this spirit and these supplies our "victories
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and successes<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>" have in great measure been owing,
is it quite right, is it generous to say, with the remarker,
that the people "had no share in acquiring them?"
The mere mob he cannot mean, even where he speaks
of the madness of the people; for the madness of the
mob must be too feeble and impotent, armed as the government
of this country at present is, to "overrule<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>,"
even in the slightest instances, the virtue "and moderation"
of a firm and steady ministry.</p>

<p>While the war continues, its final event is quite uncertain.
The victorious of this year may be the vanquished
of the next. It may therefore be too early to
say, what advantages we ought absolutely to insist on,
and make the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine quibus non</i> of a peace. If the necessity
of our affairs should oblige us to accept of terms
less advantageous than our present successes seem to
promise us; an intelligent people, as ours is, must see
that necessity, and will acquiesce. But as a peace,
when it is made, may be made hastily; and as the unhappy
continuance of the war affords us time to consider,
among several advantages gained or to be gained,
which of them may be most for our interest to retain,
if some and not all may possibly be retained; I do not
blame the public disquisition of these points, as premature
or useless. Light often arises from a collision of
opinions, as fire from flint and steel; and if we can obtain
the benefit of the <em>light</em>, without danger from the
<em>heat</em> sometimes produced by controversy, why should
we discourage it?</p>

<p>Supposing then, that heaven may still continue to
bless his majesty's arms, and that the event of this just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
war may put it in our power to retain some of our conquests
at the making of a peace; let us consider,</p>

<p class="negidt1">[1. <em>The security of a dominion, a justifiable and prudent
ground upon which to demand cessions from an enemy.</em>]</p>

<p><em>Whether we are</em> to confine ourselves to those possessions
only <em>that were "the objects for which we began the
war<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>."</em> This the remarker seems to think right, when
the question relates to "<em>Canada, properly so called</em>; it
having never been mentioned as one of those objects,
in any of our memorials or declarations, or in any national
or public act whatsoever." But the gentleman
himself will probably agree, that if the cession of Canada
would be a real advantage to us; we may demand
it under his second head, as an "<em>indemnification</em> for the
charges incurred" in recovering our just rights; otherwise,
according to his own principles, the demand of
Guadaloupe can have no foundation.&mdash;That "our
claims before the war were large enough for possession
and for security too<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>," though it seems a clear point
with the ingenious remarker, is, I own, not so with me.
I am rather of the contrary opinion, and shall presently
give my reasons.</p>

<p>But first let me observe, that we did not make those
claims because they were large enough for security, but
because we could rightfully claim no more. Advantages
gained in the course of this war may increase the
extent of our rights. Our claims before the war contained
<em>some</em> security; but that is no reason why we
should neglect acquiring <em>more</em>, when the demand of
more is become reasonable. It may be reasonable in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the case of America, to ask for the security recommended
by the author of the Letter<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>, though it would
be preposterous to do it in many other cases. His
proposed demand is founded on the little value of Canada
to the French; the right we have to ask, and the
power we may have to insist on an indemnification for
our expences; the difficulty the French themselves will
be under of restraining their restless subjects in America
from encroaching on our limits and disturbing our
trade; and the difficulty on our parts of preventing
encroachments, that may possibly exist many years
without coming to our knowledge.</p>

<p>But the remarker "does not see why the arguments,
employed concerning a security for a peaceable behaviour
in Canada, would not be equally cogent for calling
for the same security in Europe<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>." On a little farther
reflection, he must I think be sensible, that the
circumstances of the two cases are widely different.&mdash;<em>Here</em>
we are separated by the best and clearest of boundaries,
the ocean, and we have people in or near every
part of our territory. Any attempt to encroach upon
us, by building a fort even in the obscurest corner of
these islands, must therefore be known and prevented
immediately. The aggressors also must be known, and
the nation they belong to would be accountable for
their aggression. In America it is quite otherwise. A
vast wilderness, thinly or scarce at all peopled, conceals
with ease the march of troops and workmen. Important
passes may be seized within our limits, and forts
built in a month, at a small expence, that may cost us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
an age, and a million, to remove. Dear experience has
taught this. But what is still <em>worse</em>, the wide extended
forests between our settlements and theirs, are inhabited
by barbarous tribes of savages, that delight in war,
and take pride in murder; subjects properly neither of
the French nor English, but strongly attached to the
former by the art and indefatigable industry of priests,
similarity of superstitions, and frequent family alliances.
These are easily, and have been continually, instigated
to fall upon and massacre our planters, even in times of
full peace between the two crowns; to the certain diminution
of our people and the contraction of our settlements<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.
And though it is known they are supplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
by the French, and carry their prisoners to them, we
can, by complaining, obtain no redress; as the governors
of Canada have a ready excuse, that the Indians
are an independent people, over whom they have no
power, and for whose actions they are therefore not
accountable. Surely circumstances so widely different
may reasonably authorise different demands of security
in America, from such as are usual or necessary in
Europe.</p>

<p>The remarker however thinks, that our real dependance
for keeping "France or any other nation true to
her engagements, must not be in demanding securities
which no nation whilst <em>independent</em> can give; but on
our own strength and our own vigilance<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>." No nation
that has carried on a war with disadvantage, and is unable
to continue it, can be said, under such circumstances,
to be <em>independent</em>; and while either side thinks
itself in a condition to demand an indemnification,
there is no man in his senses, but will, cæteris paribus,
prefer an indemnification, that is a cheaper and more
effectual security than any other he can think of. Nations
in this situation demand and cede countries by
almost every treaty of peace that is made. The French
part of the island of St. Christophers was added to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Great Britain in circumstances altogether similar to
those in which a few months may probably place the
country of Canada. Farther security has always been
deemed a motive with a conqueror to be less moderate;
and even the <em>vanquished</em> insist upon security as a reason
for demanding what they acknowledge they could not
otherwise properly ask. The security of the frontier
of France <em>on the side of the Netherlands</em> was always
considered in the negotiation, that began at Gertrudenburgh,
and ended with that war. For the same reason
they demanded and had Cape Breton. But a war, concluded
to the advantage of France, has always added
something to the power, either of France, or the house
of Bourbon. Even that of 1733, which she commenced
with declarations of her having no ambitious views, and
which finished by a treaty, at which the ministers of
France repeatedly declared, that she desired nothing
for herself, in effect gained for her Lorrain, an indemnification
ten times the value of all her North American
possessions. In short, security and quiet of princes
and states have ever been deemed sufficient reasons,
when supported by power, for disposing of rights; and
such disposition has never been looked on as want of
moderation. It has always been the foundation of the
most general treaties. The security of Germany was
the argument for yielding considerable possessions there
to the Swedes: and the security of Europe divided the
Spanish monarchy by the partition-treaty, made between
powers who had no other right to dispose of any
part of it. There can be no cession that is not supposed
at least, to increase the power of the party to
whom it is made. It is enough that he has a right to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
ask it, and that he does it not merely to serve the purposes
of a dangerous ambition.</p>

<p>Canada, in the hands of Britain, will endanger the
kingdom of France as little as any other cession; and
from its situation and circumstances cannot be hurtful
to any other state. Rather, if peace be an advantage,
this cession may be such to all Europe. The present
war teaches us, that disputes arising in America may
be an occasion of embroiling nations; who have no concerns
there. If the French remain in Canada and Louisiana,
fix the boundaries as you will between us and
them, we must border on each other for more than fifteen
hundred miles. The people that inhabit the frontiers
are generally the refuse of both nations, often of
the worst morals and the least discretion; remote from
the eye, the prudence, and the restraint of government.
Injuries are therefore frequently, in some part or other
of so long a frontier, committed on both sides, resentment
provoked, the colonies first engaged, and then the
mother countries. And two great nations can scarce
be at war in Europe, but some other prince or state
thinks it a convenient opportunity to revive some ancient
claim, seize some advantage, obtain some territory,
or enlarge some power at the expence of a neighbour.
The flames of war, once kindled, often spread
far and wide, and the mischief is infinite. Happy it
proved to both nations, that the Dutch were prevailed
on finally to cede the New Netherlands (now the province
of New York) to us at the peace of 1674; a
peace that has ever since continued between us, but
must have been frequently disturbed, if they had retained
the possession of that country, bordering several
hundred miles on our colonies of Pensylvania westward,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Connecticut and the Massachusetts eastward.
Nor is it to be wondered at, that people of different language,
religion, and manners, should in those remote
parts engage in frequent quarrels; when we find, that
even the people of our <em>own colonies</em> have frequently
been so exasperated against <em>each other</em>, in their disputes
about boundaries, as to proceed to open violence and
bloodshed.</p>

<p class="negidt1">[2. <em>Erecting forts in the back settlements, almost in no instance
a sufficient security against the Indians and the
French; but the possession of Canada implies every security,
and ought to be had, while in our power.</em>]</p>

<p>But the remarker thinks <em>we shall be</em> sufficiently <em>secure
in America, if we "raise English forts at such passes as
may at once make us respectable to the French and to the
Indian nations<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>."</em> The security desirable in America
may be considered as of three kinds. 1. A security of
possession, that the French shall not drive us out of
the country. 2. A security of our planters from the
inroads of savages, and the murders committed by
them. 3. A security that the British nation shall not
be obliged, on every new war, to repeat the immense
expence occasioned by this, to defend its possessions in
America. Forts, in the most important passes, may, I
acknowledge, be of use to obtain the <em>first</em> kind of security:
but as those situations are far advanced beyond
the inhabitants, the expence of maintaining and supplying
the garrisons will be very great even in time of
full peace, and immense on every interruption of it; as
it is easy for skulking-parties of the enemy, in such long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
roads through the woods, to intercept and cut off our
convoys, unless guarded continually by great bodies of
men.&mdash;The <em>second</em> kind of security will not be obtained
by such forts, unless they were connected by a wall like
that of China, from one end of our settlements to the
other. If the Indians, when at war, marched like the
Europeans, with great armies, heavy cannon, baggage,
and carriages; the passes through which alone such
armies could penetrate our country, or receive their supplies,
being secured, all might be sufficiently secure;
but the case is widely different. They go to war, as
they call it, in small parties; from fifty men down to
five. Their hunting life has made them acquainted
with the whole country, and scarce any part of it is
impracticable to such a party. They can travel through
the woods even by night, and know how to conceal
their tracks. They pass easily between your forts undiscovered;
and privately approach the settlements of
your frontier inhabitants. They need no convoys of
provisions to follow them; for whether they are shifting
from place to place in the woods, or lying in wait
for an opportunity to strike a blow, every thicket and
every stream furnishes so small a number with sufficient
subsistence. When they have surprised separately,
and murdered and scalped a dozen families, they are
gone with inconceivable expedition through unknown
ways; and it is very rare that pursuers have any chance
of coming up with them<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. In short, long experience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
has taught our planters, that they cannot rely upon forts
as a security against Indians: the inhabitants of Hackney
might as well rely upon the tower of London, to secure
them against highwaymen and housebreakers.&mdash;As to
the <em>third</em> kind of security, that we shall not, in a few
years, have all we have now done, to do over again in
America, and be obliged to employ the same number
of troops, and ships, at the same immense expence, to
defend our possessions there, while we are in proportion
weakened here: such forts I think, cannot prevent this.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
During a peace, it is not to be doubted the French, who
are adroit at fortifying, will likewise erect forts in the
most advantageous places of the country we leave them;
which will make it more difficult than ever to be reduced
in case of another war. We know by the experience
of this war, how extremely difficult it is to march
an army through the American woods, with its necessary
cannon and stores, sufficient to reduce a very
slight fort. The accounts at the treasury will tell you,
what amazing sums we have necessarily spent in the expeditions
against two very trifling forts, Duquesne, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Crown Point. While the French retain their influence
over the Indians, they can easily keep our long extended
frontier in continual alarm, by a very few of those people;
and with a small number of regulars and militia,
in such a country, we find they can keep an army of
ours in full employ for several years. We therefore
shall not need to be told by our colonies, that if we
leave Canada, however circumscribed, to the French,
"we have done nothing<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>;" we shall soon be made sensible
<em>ourselves</em> of this truth, and to our cost.</p>

<p>I would not be understood to deny, that even if we
subdue and retain Canada, some <em>few forts</em> may be of
use to secure the goods of the traders, and protect the
commerce, in case of any sudden misunderstanding
with any tribe of Indians: but these forts will be best
under the care of the colonies interested in the Indian
trade, and garrisoned by their provincial forces, and at
their own expence. Their own interest will then induce
the American governments to take care of such forts in
proportion to their importance, and see that the officers
keep their corps full, and mind their duty. But
any troops of ours placed there, and accountable here,
would, in such remote and obscure places, and at so
great a distance from the eye and inspection of superiors,
soon become of little consequence, even though the
French were left in possession of Canada. If the four
independent companies, maintained by the crown in
New York more than forty years, at a great expence,
consisted, for most part of the time, of faggots chiefly;
if their officers enjoyed their places as sinecures, and
were only, as a writer<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> of that country styles them, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
kind of military monks; if this was the state of troops
posted in a populous country, where the imposition
could not be so well concealed; what may we expect
will be the case of those, that shall be posted two, three,
or four hundred miles from the inhabitants, in such obscure
and remote places as Crown Point, Oswego, Duquesne,
or Niagara? they would scarce be even faggots;
they would dwindle to <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'meer names'">mere names</ins> upon paper, and appear
no where but upon the muster-rolls.</p>

<p>Now <em>all the kinds</em> of security we have mentioned are
obtained by subduing and <em>retaining</em> Canada. Our present
possessions in America are secured; our planters
will no longer be massacred by the Indians, who, depending
absolutely on us for what are now become the
necessaries of life to them (guns, powder, hatchets,
knives, and clothing) and having no other Europeans
near, that can either supply them, or instigate them
against us; there is no doubt of their being always disposed,
if we treat them with common justice, to live in
perpetual peace with us. And with regard to France,
she cannot, in case of another war, put us to the immense
expence of defending that long extended frontier;
we shall then, as it were, have our backs against
a wall in America; the sea coast will be easily protected
by our superior naval power: and here "our own
watchfulness and our own strength" will be properly,
and cannot but be successfully employed. In this situation,
the force, now employed in that part of the world,
may be spared for any other service here or elsewhere;
so that both the offensive and defensive strength of the
British empire, on the whole, will be greatly increased.</p>

<p>But to leave the French in possession of Canada,
<em>when it is in our power to remove them, and depend</em> (as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the remarker proposes) <em>on our own</em> "strength and watchfulness<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>"
<em>to prevent the mischiefs that may attend it,
seems neither safe nor prudent</em>. Happy as we now are,
under the best of kings, and in the prospect of a succession
promising every felicity a nation was ever blessed
with; happy too in the wisdom and vigour of every
part of the administration; we cannot, we ought not
to promise ourselves the uninterrupted continuance of
those blessings. The safety of a considerable part of
the state, and the interest of the whole, are not to be
trusted to the wisdom and vigour of <em>future administrations</em>;
when a security is to be had more effectual,
more constant, and much less expensive. They, who
can be moved by the apprehension of dangers so remote,
as that of the future independence of our colonies
(a point I shall hereafter consider) seem scarcely
consistent with themselves, when they suppose we may
rely on the wisdom and vigour of an administration for
their safety.&mdash;I should indeed think it less material
whether Canada were ceded to us or not, if I had in
view only the security of <em>possession</em> in our colonies. I
entirely agree with the remarker, that we are in North
America "a far greater continental as well as naval
power;" and that only cowardice or ignorance can subject
our colonies there to a French conquest. But for
the same reason I disagree with him widely upon another
point.</p>

<p class="negidt1">[3. <em>The blood and treasure spent in the American wars, not
spent in the cause of the colonies alone.</em>]</p>

<p>I do not think, that our "blood and treasure has been
expended," as he intimates, "<em>in the cause of the colonies</em>,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and that we are "making conquests for <em>them</em><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>;"
yet I believe this is too common an error. I do not say,
they are altogether unconcerned in the event. The
inhabitants of them are, in common with the other subjects
of Great Britain, anxious for the glory of her crown,
the extent of her power and commerce, the welfare and
future repose of the whole British people. They could
not therefore but take a large share in the affronts offered
to Britain; and have been animated with a truly British
spirit to exert themselves beyond their strength,
and against their evident interest. Yet so unfortunate
have they been, that their virtue has made against
them; for upon no better foundation than this have
they been supposed the authors of a war, carried on for
their advantage only. It is a great mistake to imagine,
that the American country in question between Great
Britain and France is claimed as the property of any
<em>individuals or public body in America</em>; or that the possession
of it by Great Britain is likely, in any lucrative
view, to redound at all to the advantage of any person
there. On the other hand, the bulk of the inhabitants
of North America are <em>land-owners</em>, whose lands are inferior
in value to those of Britain, only by the want of
an equal number of people. It is true, the accession
of the large territory claimed before the war began
(especially if that be secured by the possession of Canada)
will tend to the increase of the British subjects
faster, than if they had been confined within the mountains:
yet the increase within the mountains only
would evidently make the comparative population equal
to that of Great Britain much sooner than it can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
expected, when our people are spread over a country
six times as large. I think this is the only point of
light in which this question is to be viewed, and is the
only one in which any of the colonies are concerned.&mdash;No
colony, no possessor of lands in any colony, therefore
wishes for conquests, or can be benefitted by them,
otherwise than as they may be a means of <em>securing peace
on their borders</em>. No considerable advantage has resulted
to the colonies by the conquests of this war, or can
result from confirming them by the peace, but what
they must enjoy in common with the rest of the British
people; with this evident drawback from their share of
these advantages, that they will necessarily lessen, or at
least prevent the increase of the value of what makes
the principal part of their private property [their land].
A people, spread through the whole tract of country on
this side the Mississippi, and secured by Canada in our
hands, would probably for some centuries find employment
in agriculture, and thereby free us at home effectually
from our fears of American manufactures. Unprejudiced
men well know, that all the penal and prohibitory
laws that ever were thought on will not be sufficient
to prevent manufactures in a country, whose inhabitants
surpass the number that can subsist by the husbandry
of it. That this will be the case in America
soon, if our people remain confined within the mountains,
and almost as soon should it be unsafe for them
to live beyond, though the country be ceded to us, no
man acquainted with political and commercial history
can doubt. Manufactures are founded in poverty: it
is the multitude of poor without land in a country, and
who must work for others at low wages or starve, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
enables undertakers to carry on a manufacture, and afford
it cheap enough to prevent the importation of the
same kind from abroad, and to bear the expence of its
own exportation.&mdash;But no man, who can have a piece
of land of his own, sufficient by his labour to subsist his
family in plenty, is poor enough to be a manufacturer,
and work for a master. Hence, while there is land
enough in America for our people, there can never be
manufactures to any amount or value. It is a striking
observation of a very <em>able pen</em><a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, that the natural livelihood
of the thin inhabitants of a forest country is hunting;
that of a greater number, pasturage: that of a middling
population, agriculture; and that of the greatest,
manufactures; which last must subsist the bulk of the
people in a full country, or they must be subsisted by
charity, or perish. The extended population, therefore,
that is most advantageous to Great Britain, will
be best effected, because only effectually secured, by
our possession of Canada.</p>

<p>So far as the <em>being</em> of our present colonies in North
America is concerned, I think indeed with the remarker,
that the French there are not <em>"an enemy to be apprehended<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>;"</em>&mdash;but
the expression is too vague to be applicable
to the present, or indeed to any other case.
Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, unequal as they are to this
nation in power and numbers of people, are enemies to
be still apprehended; and the Highlanders of Scotland
have been so for many ages, by the greatest princes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Scotland and Britain. The wild Irish were able to give
a great deal of disturbance even to Queen Elizabeth,
and cost her more blood and treasure than her war with
Spain. Canada, in the hands of France, has always
stinted the growth of our colonies, in the course of this
war, and indeed before it, has disturbed and vexed
even the best and strongest of them; has found means
to murder thousands of their people, and unsettle a
great part of their country. Much more able will it be
to starve the growth of an infant settlement. Canada
has also found means to make this nation spend two or
three millions a year in America; and a people, how
small soever, that in their present situation, can do this
as often as we have a war with them, is, methinks,
"an enemy to be apprehended."</p>

<p>Our North American colonies are to be considered
as the <em>frontier of the British empire</em> on that side. The
frontier of any dominion being attacked, it becomes not
merely "the cause" of the people immediately attacked
(the inhabitants of that frontier) but properly
"the cause" of the whole body. Where the
frontier people owe and pay obedience, there they have
a right to look for protection: no political proposition
is better established than this. It is therefore invidious,
to represent the "blood and treasure" spent in this war,
as spent in "the cause of the colonies" only; and that
they are "absurd and ungrateful," if they think we have
done nothing, unless we "make conquests for them,"
and reduce Canada to gratify their "vain ambition,"
&amp;c. It will not be a conquest for <em>them</em>, nor gratify any
vain ambition of theirs. It will be a conquest for the
<em>whole</em>; and all our people will, in the increase of trade,
and the ease of taxes, find the advantage of it. Should
we be obliged at any time, to make a war for the protection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of our commerce, and to secure the exportation
of our manufactures, would it be fair to represent such
a war, merely as blood and treasure spent in the cause
of the weavers of Yorkshire, Norwich, or the West;
the cutlers of Sheffield, or the button-makers of Birmingham?
I hope it will appear before I end these
sheets, that if ever there was a national war, this is truly
such a one: a war in which the interest of the whole
nation is directly and fundamentally concerned. Those,
who would be thought deeply skilled in human nature,
affect to discover self-interested views every where at
the bottom of the fairest, the most generous conduct.
Suspicions and charges of this kind meet with ready
reception and belief in the minds even of the multitude,
and therefore less acuteness and address, than the
remarker is possessed of, would be sufficient to persuade
the nation generally, that all the zeal and spirit, manifested
and exerted by the colonies in this war, was only
in "their own cause," to "make conquests for themselves,"
to engage us to make more for them, to gratify
their own "vain ambition."</p>

<p>But should they now humbly address the mother-country
in the terms and the sentiments of the remarker;
return her their grateful acknowledgments for
the blood and treasure she had spent in "their cause;"
confess that enough had not been done "for them;"
allow that "English forts, raised in proper passes, will,
with the wisdom and vigour of her administration," be
a sufficient future protection; express their desires that
their people may be confined within the mountains,
lest [if] they are suffered to spread and extend themselves
in the fertile and pleasant country on the other
side, they should "increase infinitely from all causes,"
"live wholly on their own labour" and become independent;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
beg therefore that the French may be suffered
to remain in possession of Canada, as their neighbourhood
may be useful to prevent our increase, and
the removing them may "in its consequences be even
dangerous<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>:"&mdash;I say, should such an address from the
colonies make its appearance here (though, according
to the remarker, it would be a most just and reasonable
one) would it not, might it not with more justice be answered:&mdash;We
understand you, gentlemen, perfectly
well: you have only your own interest in view: you
want to have the people confined within your present
limits, that in a few years the lands you are possessed
of may increase tenfold in value! you want to reduce
the price of labour, by increasing numbers on the same
territory, that you may be able to set up manufactures
and vie with your mother-country! you would have
your people kept in a body, that you may be more able
to dispute the commands of the crown, and obtain an
independency. You would have the French left in Canada,
to exercise your military virtue, and make you
a warlike people, that you may have more confidence
to embark in schemes of disobedience, and greater ability
to support them! You have tasted too, the sweets
of <span class="xs lsp2">TWO OR THREE MILLIONS</span> sterling per annum
spent among you by our fleets and forces, and you are
unwilling to be without a pretence for kindling up another
war, and thereby occasioning a repetition of the
same delightful doses! But, gentlemen, allow us to understand
<em>our</em> interest a little likewise: we shall remove
the French from Canada, that you may live in peace,
and we be no more drained by your quarrels. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
shall have land enough to cultivate, that you may have
neither necessity nor inclination to go into manufactures;
and we will manufacture for you, and govern
you.</p>

<p>A reader of the Remarks may be apt to say, if this
writer would have us restore Canada, on principles of
moderation, how can we, consistent with those principles,
retain Guadaloupe, which he represents of so
much greater value!&mdash;I will endeavour to explain this,
because by doing it I shall have an opportunity of
showing the truth and good sense of the answer to the
interested application I have just supposed: The author
then is only apparently and not really inconsistent with
himself. If we can obtain the credit of moderation by
restoring Canada, it is well: but we should, however,
restore it at <em>all events</em>; because it would not only be of
no use to us; but "the possession of it (in his opinion)
may in its consequences be dangerous<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>." As how?
Why, plainly, (at length it comes out) if the French are
not left there to check the growth of our colonies,
"they will extend themselves almost without bounds
into the inland parts, and increase infinitely from all
causes; becoming a numerous, hardy, independent people;
possessed of a strong country, communicating little
or not at all with England, living wholly on their
own labour, and in process of time knowing little and
enquiring little about the mother-country." In short,
according to this writer, our present colonies are large
enough and numerous enough; and the French ought
to be left in North America to prevent their increase,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
lest they become not only useless, but dangerous to
Britain. I agree with the Gentleman, that with Canada
in our possession, our people in America will increase
amazingly. I know, that their common rate of
increase, where they are not molested by the enemy, is
doubling their numbers every twenty-five years, by natural
generation only; exclusive of the accession of foreigners<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.
I think this increase continuing would
probably, in a century more, make the number of British
subjects on that side the water more numerous than
they now are on this; But,</p>

<p class="negidt1">[4. <em>Not necessary that the American colonies should</em> cease
being useful to the <em>mother-country</em>. <em>Their</em> preference
<em>over the West-Indian colonies stated</em>.]</p>

<p><em>I am far from entertaining on that account, any fears
of their becoming either useless or dangerous to us; and I
look on those fears to be merely imaginary, and without
any probable foundation.</em>&mdash;The remarker is reserved in
giving his reasons; as in his opinion this "is not a fit
subject for discussion."&mdash;I shall give mine, because I
conceive it a subject necessary to be discussed; and
the rather, as those fears, how groundless and chimerical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
soever, may, by possessing the multitude, possibly
induce the ablest ministry to conform to them against
their own judgment; and thereby prevent the assuring
to the British name and nation a stability and permanency,
that no man acquainted with history durst have
hoped for, till our American possessions opened the
pleasing prospect. The remarker thinks, that our people
in America, "finding no check from Canada, would
extend themselves almost without bounds into the inland
parts, and increase infinitely from all causes." The
very reason he assigns for their so extending, and
which is indeed the true one (their being "invited to
it by the pleasantness, fertility, and plenty of the country,")
may satisfy us, that this extension will continue
to proceed, as long as there remains any pleasant fertile
country within their reach. And if we even suppose
them confined by the waters of the Mississippi
westward, and by those of St. Laurence and the lakes
to the northward; yet still we shall leave them room
enough to increase, even in the manner of settling now
practised there, till they amount to perhaps a hundred
millions of souls. This must take some centuries to
fulfil: and in the <em>mean time</em>, this nation must necessarily
supply them with the manufactures they consume;
because the new settlers will be employed in agriculture;
and the new settlements will so continually draw
off the spare hands from the old, that our present colonies
will not, during the period we have mentioned,
find themselves in a condition to manufacture, even for
their own inhabitants, to any considerable degree, much
less for those who are settling behind them.</p>

<p>Thus our trade must, till that country becomes as
fully peopled as England (that is for centuries to come)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
be continually increasing, and with it our naval power;
because the ocean is between us and them, and our ships
and seamen must increase as that trade increases.&mdash;The
human body and the political differ in this; that
the first is limited by nature to a certain stature, which,
when attained, it cannot ordinarily exceed: the other,
by better government and more prudent police, as well
as by change of manners and other circumstances,
often takes fresh starts of growth, after being long at a
stand; and may add tenfold to the dimensions it had
for ages been confined to. The mother, being of full
stature, is in a few years equalled by a growing daughter:
but in the case of a mother-country and her colonies,
it is quite different. The growth of the children
tends to increase the growth of the mother, and so the
difference and superiority is longer preserved. Were
the inhabitants of this island limited to their present
number by any thing in nature, or by unchangeable
circumstances, the equality of population between the
two countries might indeed sooner come to pass: but
sure experience, in those parts of the island where manufactures
have been introduced, teaches us; that people
increase and multiply in proportion as the means
and facility of gaining a livelihood increase; and that
this island, if they could be employed, is capable of
supporting ten times its present number of people. In
proportion, therefore, as the demand increases for the
manufactures of Britain, by the increase of people in
her colonies, the number of her people at home will increase;
and with them, the strength as well as the
wealth of the nation. For satisfaction in this point, let
the reader compare in his mind the number and force
of our present fleets, with our fleet in Queen Elizabeth's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
time<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>, before we had colonies. Let him compare the
ancient, with the present state of our towns on or near
our western coast (Manchester, Liverpool, Kendal,
Lancaster, Glasgow, and the countries round them)
that trade with any manufacture for our colonies (not
to mention Leeds, Halifax, Sheffield, and Birmingham,)
and consider what a difference there is in the numbers
of people, buildings, rents, and the value of land and of
the produce of land; even if he goes back no farther
than is within man's memory. Let him compare those
countries with others on the same island, where manufactures
have not yet extended themselves; observe the
present difference, and reflect how much greater our
strength may be (if numbers give strength) when our
manufacturers shall occupy every part of the island
where they can possibly be subsisted.</p>

<p>But, say the objectors, "there is a <em>certain distance from
the sea</em>, in America, beyond which the expence of carriage
will put a stop to the sale and consumption of
your manufactures; and this, with the difficulty of making
returns for them, will oblige the inhabitants to manufacture
for themselves; of course, if you suffer your
people to extend their settlements beyond that distance,
your people become useless to you:" and this distance
is limited by some to two hundred miles, by others to
the Apalachian mountains.&mdash;Not to insist on a very
plain truth, that no part of a dominion, from whence a
government may on occasion draw supplies and aids
both of men and money (though at too great a distance
to be supplied with manufactures from some other part)
is therefore to be deemed useless to the whole; I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
endeavour to show, that these imaginary limits of utility,
even in point of commerce, are much too narrow.
The inland parts of the continent of Europe are farther
from the sea, than the limits of settlement proposed for
America. Germany is full of tradesmen and artificers
of all kinds, and the governments there are not all of
them always favourable to the commerce of Britain;
yet it is a well-known fact, that our manufactures find
their way even into the heart of Germany. Ask the
great manufacturers and merchants of the Leeds, Sheffield,
Birmingham, Manchester, and Norwich goods;
and they will tell you, that some of them send their riders
frequently through France or Spain, and Italy, up
to Vienna, and back through the middle and northern
parts of Germany, to show samples of their wares, and
collect orders, which they receive by almost every mail,
to a vast amount. Whatever charges arise on the carriage
of goods are added to the value, and all paid by
the consumer. If these nations, over whom we have
no government, over whose consumption we can have
no influence, but what arises from the cheapness and
goodness of our wares, whose trade, manufactures, or
commercial connections are not subject to the control
of our laws, as those of our colonies certainly are in
some degree; I say, if these nations purchase and consume
such quantities of our goods, notwithstanding the
remoteness of their situation from the sea; how much
less likely is it, that the settlers in America, who must
for ages be employed in agriculture chiefly, should
make cheaper for themselves the goods our manufacturers
at present supply them with: even if we suppose
the carriage five, six, or seven hundred miles from the
sea as difficult and expensive, as the like distance into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Germany: whereas in the latter, the natural distances
are frequently doubled by political obstructions; I mean
the intermixed territories and clashing interests of princes<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.
But when we consider, that the inland parts of
America are penetrated by great navigable rivers;
that there are a number of great lakes, communicating
with each other, with those rivers, and with the
sea, very small portages here and there excepted<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>;
that the sea-coasts (if one may be allowed the expression)
of those lakes only amount at least to two
thousand seven hundred miles, exclusive of the rivers
running into them (many of which are navigable
to a great extent for boats and canoes, through vast
tracts of country); how little likely is it that the expence
on the carriage of our goods into those countries should
prevent the use of them. If the poor Indians in those
remote parts are now able to pay for the linen, woollen,
and iron wares they are at present furnished with by
the French and English traders (though Indians have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
nothing but what they get by hunting, and the goods
are loaded with all the impositions fraud and knavery
can contrive to inhance their value) will not industrious
English farmers, hereafter settled in those countries,
be much better able to pay for what shall be brought
them in the way of fair commerce?</p>

<p>If it is asked, <em>What</em> can such farmers raise, wherewith
to pay for the manufactures they may want from
us? I answer, that the inland parts of America in question
are well known to be fitted for the production of
hemp, flax, pot-ash, and above all, silk; the southern
parts may produce olive-oil, raisins, currants, indigo,
and cochineal. Not to mention horses and black cattle,
which may easily be driven to the maritime markets,
and at the same time assist in conveying other
commodities. That the commodities first mentioned
may easily, by water and land-carriage, be brought to
the sea-ports from interior America, will not seem incredible,
when we reflect, that <em>hemp</em> formerly came
from the Ukraine and most southern parts of Russia to
Wologda, and down the Dwina to Archangel; and
thence, by a perilous navigation, round the North Cape
to England, and other parts of Europe. It now comes
from the same country up the Dnieper, and down the
Duna<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>, with much land-carriage. Great part of the
Russia <em>iron</em>, no high-priced commodity, is brought three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
hundred miles by land and water from the heart of Siberia.
<em>Furs</em> [the produce too of America] are brought
to Amsterdam from all parts of Siberia, even the most
remote, Kamstchatka. The same country furnishes me
with another instance of extended inland commerce.
It is found worth while to keep up a mercantile communication
between Pekin in China, and Petersburgh.
And none of these instances of inland commerce <em>exceed</em>
those of the courses by which, at several periods, <em>the
whole trade of the East</em> was carried on. Before the
prosperity of the Mameluke dominion in Egypt fixed
the staple for the riches of the East at Cairo and Alexandria
(whither they were brought from the Red Sea)
great part of those commodities were carried to the cities
of Cashgar and Balk. (This gave birth to those
towns, that still subsist upon the remains of their ancient
opulence, amidst a people and country equally wild.)
From thence those goods were carried down the Amû
(the ancient Oxus) to the Caspian Sea, and up the
Wolga to Astrachan; from whence they were carried
over to, and down the Don, to the mouth of that river;
and thence again the Venetians directly, and the Genoese
and Venetians indirectly (by way of Kaffa and
Trebisonde) dispersed them through the Mediterranean
and some other parts of Europe. Another part of those
goods was carried over-land from the Wolga to the rivers
Duna and Neva; from both they were carried to
the city of Wisbuy in the Baltic (so eminent for its
sea-laws); and from the city of Ladoga on the Neva,
we are told they were even carried by the Dwina to
Archangel; and from thence round the North Cape.&mdash;If
iron and hemp will bear the charge of carriage from
this inland country, <em>other metals</em> will, as well as iron;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and certainly <em>silk</em>, since 3<em>d.</em> per <em>lb.</em> is not above 1 per
cent on the value, and amounts to 28<em>l.</em> per ton. If the
<em>growths</em> of a country find their way out of it; the <em>manufactures</em>
of the country where they go will infallibly
find their way into it.</p>

<p>They, who understand the economy and principles of
manufactures, know, that it is impossible to establish
them in places not populous: and even in those that
are populous, hardly possible to establish them to the
prejudices of the places <em>already in possession of them</em>.
Several attempts have been made in France and Spain,
countenanced by the government, to draw from us, and
establish in those countries, our hard-ware and woollen
manufactures; but without success. The reasons are
various. A manufacture is part of a great system of
commerce, which takes in conveniencies of various
kinds; methods of providing materials of all sorts, machines
for expediting and facilitating labour, all the
channels of correspondence for vending the wares, the
credit and confidence necessary to found and support
this correspondence, the mutual aid of different artizans,
and a thousand other particulars, which time and
long experience have <em>gradually</em> established. A part of
such a system cannot support itself without the whole:
and before the whole can be obtained the part perishes.
Manufactures, where they are in perfection, are carried
on by a multiplicity of hands, each of which is expert
only in his own part; no one of them a master of the
whole; and, if by any means spirited away to a foreign
country, he is lost without his fellows. Then it is a
matter of the extremest difficulty to persuade a complete
set of workmen, skilled in all parts of a manufactory,
to leave their country together, and settle in a foreign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
land. Some of the idle and drunken may be enticed
away; but these only disappoint their employers,
and serve to discourage the undertaking. If by royal
munificence, and an expence that the profits of the
trade alone would not bear, a complete set of good and
skilful hands are collected and carried over, they find
so much of the system imperfect, so many things wanting
to carry on the trade to advantage, so many difficulties
to overcome, and the knot of hands so easily
broken by death, dissatisfaction, and desertion; that
they and their employers are discouraged together, and
the project vanishes into smoke. Hence it happens,
that established manufactures are hardly ever lost, but
by foreign conquest, or by some eminent interior fault
in manners or government; a bad police oppressing
and discouraging the workmen, or religious persecutions
driving the sober and industrious out of the country.
There is, in short, scarce a single instance in history
of the contrary, where manufactures have once
taken firm root. They sometimes start up in a new
place; but are generally supported, like exotic plants, at
more expence than they are worth for any thing but
curiosity; until these new seats become the refuge of
the manufacturers driven from the old ones. The conquest
of Constantinople, and final reduction of the
Greek empire, dispersed many curious manufacturers
into different parts of Christendom. The former conquests
of its provinces, had <em>before</em> done the same.
The loss of liberty in Verona, Milan, Florence,
Pisa, Pistoia, and other great cities of Italy, drove the
manufacturers of woollen cloths into Spain and Flanders.
The latter first lost their trade and manufactures
to Antwerp and the cities of Brabant; from whence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
by persecution for religion, they were sent into Holland
and England: [while] the civil wars, during the minority
of Charles the First of Spain, which ended in the
loss of the liberty of their great towns, ended too in
the loss of the manufactures of Toledo, Segovia, Salamanca,
Medina del campo, &amp;c. The revocation of
the <em>edict of Nantes</em> communicated, to all the protestant
part of Europe, the paper, silk, and other valuable manufacturers
of France; almost peculiar at that time to
that country, and till then in vain attempted elsewhere.
To be convinced, that it is not soil and climate, or even
freedom from taxes, that determines the residence of
manufacturers, we need only turn our eyes on Holland;
where a multitude of manufactures are still carried on
(perhaps more than on the same extent of territory any
where in Europe) and sold on terms upon which they
cannot be had in any other part of the world. And
this too is true of those <em>growths</em>, which, by their nature
and the labour required to raise them, come the nearest
to manufactures.</p>

<p>As to the common-place objection to the North-American
settlements, that they are <em>in the same climate,
and their produce the same as that of England</em>;&mdash;in the
first place it is not true; it is particularly not so of the
countries now likely to be added to our settlements; and
of our present colonies, the products, lumber, tobacco,
rice, and indigo, great articles of commerce, do not interfere
with the products of England: in the next place,
a man must know very little of the trade of the world,
who does not know, that the greater part of it is carried
on between countries whose climate differs very
little. Even the trade between the different parts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
these British islands is greatly superior to that between
England and all the West India Islands put together.</p>

<p>If I have been successful in proving that a considerable
commerce may and will subsist between us and
our future most inland settlements in North America,
notwithstanding their distance; I have more than half
proved no <em>other inconveniency will arise</em> from their distance.
Many men in such a country must "know,"
must "think," and must "care" about the country
they chiefly trade with. The juridical and other connections
of government are yet a faster hold than even
commercial ties, and spread, directly and indirectly, far
and wide. Business to be solicited and causes depending
create a great intercourse, even where private property
is <em>not</em> divided in different countries;&mdash;yet this
division <em>will</em> always subsist, where different countries
are ruled by the same government. Where a man has
landed property both in the mother country and a province,
he will almost always live in the mother country:
this, though there were no trade, is singly a sufficient
gain. It is said, that Ireland pays near a million sterling
annually to its absentees in England: the balance
of trade from Spain, or even Portugal, is scarcely equal
to this.</p>

<p>Let it not be said we have <em>no absentees</em> from North
America. There are many, to the writer's knowledge;
and if there are at present but few of them, that distinguish
themselves here by great expence, it is owing to
the mediocrity of fortune among the inhabitants of the
Northern colonies, and a more equal division of landed
property, than in the West India islands, so that
there are as yet but few large estates. But if those,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
who have such estates, reside upon and take care of
them themselves, are they worse subjects than they
would be if they lived idly in England?&mdash;Great merit is
assumed for the gentlemen of the West Indies,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> on the
score of their residing and spending their money in
England. I would not depreciate that merit; it is
considerable; for they might, if they pleased, spend
their money in France: but the difference between
their spending it here and at home is not so great.
What do they spend it in when they are here, but the
produce and manufactures of this country;&mdash;and would
they not do the same if they were at home? Is it of
any great importance to the English farmer, whether
the West India gentleman comes to London and eats
his beef, pork, and tongues, fresh; or has them brought
to him in the West Indies salted? whether he eats his
English cheese and butter, or drinks his English ale, at
London or in Barbadoes? Is the clothier's, or the mercer's,
or the cutler's, or the toyman's profit less, for their
goods being worn and consumed by the same persons
residing on the other side of the ocean? Would not the
profits of the merchant and mariner be rather greater,
and some addition made to our navigation, ships and
seamen? If the North American gentleman stays in
his own country, and lives there in that degree of luxury
and expence with regard to the use of British
manufactures, that his fortune entitles him to; may
not his example (from the imitation of superiors, so
natural to mankind) spread the use of those manufactures
among hundreds of families around him, and occasion
a much greater demand for them, than it would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
do if he should remove and live in London?&mdash;However
this may be, if in our views of immediate advantage, it
seems preferable, that the gentlemen of large fortunes
in North America should reside much in England; it
is what may surely be expected, as fast as such fortunes
are acquired there. Their having "colleges of their
own for the education of their youth," will not prevent
it: a little knowledge and learning acquired increases
the appetite for more, and will make the conversation
of the learned on this side the water more strongly desired.
Ireland has its university likewise; yet this does
not prevent the immense pecuniary benefit we receive
from that kingdom. And there will always be, in the
conveniencies of life, the politeness, the pleasures, the
magnificence of the reigning country, many other attractions
besides those of learning, to draw men of
substance there, where they can (apparently at least)
have the best bargain of happiness for their money.</p>

<p>Our <em>trade to the West India islands</em> is undoubtedly a
valuable one: but whatever is the amount of it, it <em>has
long been at a stand</em>. Limited as our sugar planters are
by the scantiness of territory, they cannot increase
much beyond their present number; and this is an evil,
as I shall show hereafter, that will be little helped by
our keeping Guadaloupe.&mdash;The trade to our Northern
Colonies is not only greater, but yearly increasing with
the increase of people: and even in a greater proportion,
as the people increase in wealth and the ability of
spending, as well as in numbers.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>&mdash;I have already said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
that <em>our people in the northern colonies</em> double in about
25 years, exclusive of the accession of strangers. That
I speak within bounds, I appeal to the authentic accounts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
frequently required by the board of trade, and
transmitted to that board by the respective governors;
of which accounts I shall select one as a sample, being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
that from the colony of Rhode-Island;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> a colony that
of all the others receives the least addition from strangers.&mdash;For
the increase of our <em>trade to those colonies</em>, I
refer to the accounts frequently laid before Parliament,
by the officers of the customs, and to the custom-house
books: from which I have also selected one account,
that of the trade from England (exclusive of Scotland)
to Pensylvania<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>; a colony most remarkable for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
plain frugal manner of living of its inhabitants, and the
most suspected of carrying on manufactures, on account
of the number of German artizans, who are known to
have transplanted themselves into that country; though
even these, in truth, when they come there, generally
apply themselves to agriculture, as the surest support
and most advantageous employment. By this account
it appears, that the exports to that province have in 28
years, increased nearly in the proportion of 17 to 1;
whereas the people themselves, who by other authentic
accounts appear to double their numbers (the strangers
who settle there included) in about 16 years, cannot in
the 28 years have increased in a greater proportion
than as 4 to 1. The additional demand then, and consumption
of goods from England, of 13 parts in 17
more than the additional number would require, must
be owing to this; that the people having by their industry
mended their circumstances, are enabled to indulge
themselves in finer clothes, better furniture, and
a more general use of all our manufactures than heretofore.</p>

<p>In fact, the occasion for English goods in North
America, and the inclination to have and use them, is,
and must be for ages to come, much greater than the
ability of the people to pay for them; they must therefore,
as they now do, deny themselves many things
they would otherwise chuse to have, or increase their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
industry to obtain them. And thus, if they should at
any time manufacture some coarse article, which on
account of its bulk or some other circumstance, cannot
so well be brought to them from Britain; it only enables
them the better to pay for finer goods, that <em>otherwise</em>
they could not indulge themselves in: so that the
exports thither are not diminished by such manufacture,
but rather increased. The single article of manufacture
in these colonies, mentioned by the remarker,
is <em>hats</em> made in New-England. It is true, there have
been, ever since the first settlement of that country, a
few hatters there; drawn thither probably at first by
the facility of getting beaver, while the woods were
but little cleared, and there was plenty of those animals.
The case is greatly altered now. The beaver skins are
not now to be had in New-England, but from very remote
places and at great prices. The trade is accordingly
declining there; so that, far from being able to
make hats in any quantity for exportation, they cannot
supply their home demand; and it is well known, that
some thousand dozens are sent thither yearly from <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Londom'">London</ins>,
Bristol, and Liverpool, and sold there cheaper
than the inhabitants can make them of equal goodness.
In fact, the colonies are so little suited for establishing
of manufactures, that they are continually losing the
few branches they accidentally gain. The working
brasiers, cutlers, and pewterers, as well as hatters, who
have happened to go over from time to time and settle
in the colonies, gradually drop the working part of
their business, and import their respective goods from
England, whence they can have them cheaper and better
than they can make them. They continue their
shops indeed, in the same way of dealing; but become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
<em>sellers</em> of brasiery, cutlery, pewter, hats, &amp;c. brought
from England, instead of being <em>makers</em> of those goods.</p>

<p class="negidt1">[5. <em>The American colonies</em> not dangerous <em>in their nature
to Great Britain</em>.]</p>

<p>Thus much to the apprehension of our colonies becoming
useless to us. I shall next consider the other
supposition, that their growth may render them <em>dangerous</em>.&mdash;Of
this, I own, I have not the least conception,
when I consider that we have already <em>fourteen separate
governments</em> on the maritime coast of the continent;
and, if we extend our settlements, shall probably have
as many more behind them on the inland side. Those
we now have are not only under different governors,
but have different forms of government, different laws,
different interests, and some of them different religious
persuasions and different manners.&mdash;Their jealousy of
each other is so great, that however necessary an union
of the colonies has long been, for their common defence
and security against their enemies, and how sensible
soever each colony has been of that necessity; yet
they have never been able to effect such an union
among themselves; nor even to agree in requesting the
mother country to establish it for them. Nothing but
the immediate command of the crown has been able to
produce even the imperfect union, but lately seen
there, of the forces of some colonies. If they could
not agree to unite for their defence against the French
and Indians, who were perpetually harassing their settlements,
burning their villages, and murdering their
people; can it reasonably be supposed there is any
danger of their uniting against their own nation, which
protects and encourages them, with which they have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
so many connections and ties of blood, interest and affection,
and which, it is well known, they all love much
more than they love one another?</p>

<p>In short, there are so many causes that must operate
to prevent it, that I will venture to say, an union
amongst them for such a purpose is not merely improbable,
it is impossible. And if the union of the whole
is impossible, the attempt of a part must be madness;
as those colonies that did not join the rebellion would
join the mother-country in suppressing it. When I say
such an union is impossible, I mean, without the most
grievous tyranny and oppression. People who have
property in a country which they may lose, and privileges
which they may endanger, are generally disposed
to be quiet, and even to bear much, rather than hazard
all. While the government is mild and just, while important
civil and religious rights are secure, such subjects
will be dutiful and obedient. The waves do not
rise but when the winds blow.</p>

<p>What such an administration as the Duke of Alva's
in the Netherlands might produce, I know not; but
this I think I have a right to deem impossible. And
yet there were two very manifest differences between
that case, and ours; and both are in our favour. The
<em>first</em>, that Spain had already united the seventeen provinces
under one visible government, though the states
continued independent: the <em>second</em>, that the inhabitants
of those provinces were of a nation, not only different
from, but utterly unlike the Spaniards. Had the Netherlands
been peopled from Spain, the worst of oppression
had probably not provoked them to wish a separation
of government. It might, and probably would,
have ruined the country; but would never have produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
an independent sovereignty. In fact, neither
the very worst of governments, the worst of politics in
the last century, nor the total abolition of their remaining
liberty, in the provinces of Spain itself, in the
present, have produced any independency [in Spain]
that could be supported. The same may be observed
of France.</p>

<p>And let it not be said, that the neighbourhood of
these to the seat of government has prevented a separation.
While our strength at sea continues, the banks
of the Ohio (in point of easy and expeditious conveyance
of troops) are nearer to London, than the remote
parts of France and Spain to their respective capitals;
and much nearer than Connaught and Ulster were in
the days of Queen Elizabeth. No body foretels the
dissolution of the Russian monarchy from its extent;
yet I will venture to say, the eastern parts of it are
already much more inaccessible from Petersburgh, than
the country on the Mississippi is from London; I mean,
more men, in less time, might be conveyed the latter
than the former distance. The rivers Oby, Jenesea,
and Lena, do not facilitate the communication half so
well by their course, nor are they half so practicable as
the American rivers. To this I shall only add the observation
of Machiavel, in his Prince; that a government
seldom long preserves its dominion over those
who are foreigners to it; who, on the other hand, fall
with great ease, and continue inseparably annexed to
the government of their own nation: which he proves
by the fate of the English conquests in France. Yet
with all these disadvantages, so difficult is it to overturn
an established government, that it was not without
the assistance of France and England, that the United
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Provinces supported themselves: which teaches us,
that</p>

<p class="negidt1">[6. <em>The French remaining in Canada, an encouragement
to disaffections in the British Colonies</em>.&mdash;<em>If they prove
a</em> check, <em>that check of the most barbarous nature</em>.]</p>

<p><em>If the visionary danger of independence in our colonies
is to be feared; nothing is more likely to render it substantial,
than the neighbourhood of foreigners at enmity with
the sovereign governments, capable of giving either</em> aid<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>,
<em>or an</em> asylum, <em>as the event shall require</em>. Yet against
even these disadvantages, did Spain preserve almost
ten provinces, merely through their want of union;
which indeed could never have taken place among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
others, but for causes, some of which are in our case
impossible, and others it is impious to suppose possible.</p>

<p>The Romans well understood that policy, which
teaches the security arising to the chief government
from separate states among the governed; when they
restored the liberties of the states of Greece (oppressed
but united under Macedon) by an edict, that every
state should live under its own laws. They did not
even name a governor. Independence of each other,
and separate interests (though among a people united
by common manners, language, and I may say religion;
inferior neither in wisdom, bravery, nor their love of
liberty, to the Romans themselves;) was all the security
the sovereigns wished for their sovereignty. It is true,
they did not call themselves sovereigns; they set no value
on the title; they were contented with possessing
the thing. And possess it they did, even without a
standing army: (what can be a stronger proof of the
security of their possession?) And yet by a policy, similar
to this throughout, was the Roman world subdued
and held: a world composed of above an hundred languages,
and sets of manners, different from those of
their masters. Yet this dominion was unshakeable, till
the loss of liberty and corruption of manners in the sovereign
state overturned it.</p>

<p><em>But what is the prudent policy, inculcated by the remarker
to obtain this end, security of dominion over our
colonies? It is</em>, to leave the French <em>in</em> Canada, to
"check" their growth; <em>for otherwise, our people may
"increase infinitely from all causes<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>."</em> We have already
seen in what manner the French and their Indians
check the growth of our colonies. It is a modest word,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
this <em>check</em>, for massacring men, women, and children.
The writer would, if he could, hide from himself as well
as from the public, the horror arising from such a proposal,
by couching it in general terms: it is no wonder
he thought it a "subject not fit for discussion" in his
letter; though he recommends it as "a point that
should be the constant object of the minister's attention!"
But if Canada is restored on this principle, will
not Britain be guilty of all the blood to be shed, all the
murders to be committed, in order to check this
dreaded growth of our own people? Will not this be
telling the French in plain terms, that the horrid barbarities
they perpetrate with their Indians on our colonists
are agreeable to us; and that they need not apprehend
the resentment of a government, with whose
views they so happily concur? Will not the colonies
view it in this light? Will they have reason to consider
themselves any longer as subjects and children,
when they find their cruel enemies hallooed upon them
by the country from whence they sprung; the government
that owes them protection, as it requires their
obedience? Is not this the most likely means of driving
them into the arms of the French, who can invite them
by an offer of that security, their own government
chuses not to afford them? I would not be thought to
insinuate, that the remarker wants humanity. I know
how little many good-natured persons are affected by
the distresses of people at a distance, and whom they
do not know. There are even those, who, being present,
can sympathize sincerely with the grief of a lady
on the sudden death of a favourite bird; and yet can
read of the sinking of a city in Syria with very little
concern. If it be, after all, thought necessary to check
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the growth of our colonies, give me leave to propose a
method less cruel. It is a method of which we have an
example in scripture. The murder of husbands, of
wives, of brothers, sisters and children, whose pleasing
society has been for some time enjoyed, affects deeply
the respective surviving relations; but grief for the
death of a child just born is short, and easily supported.
The method I mean is that which was dictated by the
Egyptian policy, when the "infinite increase" of the
children of Israel was apprehended as dangerous to the
state<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. Let an act of parliament then be made, enjoining
the colony midwives to stifle in the birth every
third or fourth child. By this means you may keep
the colonies to their present size. And if they were
under the hard alternative of submitting to one or the
other of these schemes for checking their growth, I
dare answer for them, they would prefer the latter.</p>

<p><em>But all this debate about the propriety or impropriety
of keeping or restoring Canada</em> is possibly too early.
We have taken the capital indeed, but the country is
yet far from being in our possession; and perhaps never
will be: for if our m&mdash;&mdash;rs are persuaded by such
counsellors as the remarker, that the French there are
"not the worst of neighbours," and that if we had
conquered Canada, we ought, for our own sakes, to restore
it, as a check to the growth of our colonies; I am
then afraid we shall never take it. For there are many
ways of avoiding the completion of the conquest, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
will be less exceptionable and less odious than the
giving it up.</p>

<p class="negidt1">[7. <em>Canada easily peopled</em>, without draining Great Britain
<em>of any of its inhabitants</em>.]</p>

<p><em>The objection I have often heard, that if we had Canada
we could not people it, without draining Britain of
its inhabitants, is founded on ignorance of the nature of
population in new countries.</em> When we first began to
colonize in America, it was necessary to send people,
and to send seed-corn; but it is not now necessary that
we should furnish, for a new colony, either one or the
other. The annual increment alone of our present colonies,
without diminishing their numbers, or requiring
a man from hence, is sufficient in ten years to fill Canada
with double the number of English that it now has
of French inhabitants<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. Those who are protestants
among the French will probably choose to remain under
the English government; many will choose to remove,
if they can be allowed to sell their lands, improvements,
and effects: the rest in that thin-settled
country will in less than half a century, from the
crowds of English settling round and among them, be
blended and incorporated with our people both in language
and manners.</p>

<p class="negidt1">[8. <em>The merits of Guadaloupe to Great Britain</em> over-valued;
<em>yet likely to be paid</em> much dearer for, <em>than Canada</em>.]</p>

<p><em>In Guadaloupe the case is somewhat different</em>; and
though I am far from thinking<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> we have sugar-land
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>enough
<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>, I cannot think Guadaloupe is so desirable an
increase of it, as other objects the enemy would probably
be infinitely more ready to part with. A country,
<em>fully inhabited</em> by any nation, is no proper possession
for another of different languages, manners, and religion.
It is hardly ever tenable at less expence than it is
worth. But the isle of <em>Cayenne, and its appendix, Equinoctial-France</em>,
having but very few inhabitants, and
these therefore easily removed, would indeed be an acquisition
every way suitable to our situation and desires.
This would hold all that migrate from Barbadoes,
the Leeward Islands, or Jamaica. It would certainly
recal into an English government (in which
there would be room for millions) all who have before
settled or purchased in Martinico, Guadaloupe, Santa-Cruz,
or St. John's; except such as know not the value
of an English government, and such I am sure are not
worth recalling.</p>

<p>But should we keep Guadaloupe, we are told it would
<em>enable us to export </em>300,000<em>l. in sugars</em>. Admit it to be
true, though perhaps the amazing increase of English
consumption might stop most of it here,&mdash;to whose profit
is this to redound? To the profit of the French inhabitants
of the island: except a small part, that should
fall to the share of the English purchasers, but whose
whole purchase-money must first be added to the wealth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and circulation of France. I grant, however, much of
this 300,000<em>l.</em> would be expended in British manufactures.
Perhaps too, a few of the land-owners of Guadaloupe
might dwell and spend their fortunes in Britain
(though probably much fewer than of the inhabitants
of North America.) I admit the advantage arising
to us from these circumstances (as far as they go)
in the case of Guadaloupe, as well as in that of our
other West-India settlements. Yet even this consumption
is little better than that of an allied nation would be,
who should take our manufactures and supply us with
sugar, and put us to no great expence in defending the
place of growth. But though our own colonies expend
among us almost the whole produce of our sugar<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>, <em>can
we, or ought we</em> to promise ourselves this will be the case
of Guadaloupe? One 100,000<em>l.</em> will supply them with
British manufactures; and supposing we can effectually
prevent the introduction of those of France (which is
morally impossible in a country used to them) the other
200,000<em>l.</em> will still be spent in France, in the education
of their children and support of themselves; or else be
laid up there, where they will always think their home
to be.</p>

<p>Besides this consumption of British manufactures,
<em>much is said of the benefit we shall have from the</em> situation
of Guadaloupe; and we are told of a trade to the Caraccas
and Spanish Main. In what respect Guadaloupe
is better situated for this trade than Jamaica, or even
any of our other islands, I am at a loss to guess. I believe
it to be not so well situated for that of the windward
coast, as Tobago and St. Lucia; which in this, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
well as other respects, would be more valuable possessions,
and which, I doubt not, the peace will secure to us.
Nor is it nearly so well situated for that of the rest of
the Spanish Main as Jamaica. As to the greater safety
of our trade by the possession of Guadaloupe, experience
has convinced us, that in reducing a single island,
or even more, we stop the privateering business but
little. Privateers still subsist, in equal if not greater
numbers, and carry the vessels into Martinico, which
before it was more convenient to carry into Guadaloupe.
Had we all the Caribbees, it is true, they would
in those parts be without shelter.</p>

<p>Yet, upon the whole, I suppose it to be a doubtful
point, and well worth consideration, whether our obtaining
possession of all the Caribbees would be more
than a temporary benefit; as it would necessarily soon
fill the French part of Hispaniola with French inhabitants,
and thereby render it five times more valuable
in time of peace, and little less than impregnable in
time of war, and would probably end in a few years in
the uniting the whole of that great and fertile island
under a French government. It is agreed on all hands,
that our conquest of St. Christopher's, and driving the
French from thence, first furnished Hispaniola with
skilful and substantial planters, and was consequently
the first occasion of its present opulence. On the other
hand, I will hazard an opinion, that valuable as the
French possessions in the West Indies are, and undeniable
the advantages they derive from them, there is
somewhat to be weighed in the opposite scale. They
cannot at present make war with England, without exposing
those advantages, while divided among the numerous
islands they now have, much more than they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
would, were they possessed of St. Domingo only; their
own share of which would, if well cultivated, grow
more sugar, than is now grown in all their West-India
islands.</p>

<p><em>I have before said, I do not deny the utility of the conquest,
or even of our future possession of Guadaloupe, if
not bought too dear.</em> The trade of the West Indies is
one of our most valuable trades. Our possessions there
deserve our greatest care and attention. So do those
of North America. I shall not enter into the invidious
task of comparing their due estimation. It would be
a very long, and a very disagreeable one, to run through
every thing material on this head. It is enough to our
present point, if I have shown, that the value of North
America is capable of an immense increase, by an acquisition
and measures, that must necessarily have an
effect the direct contrary of what we have been industriously
taught to fear; and that Guadaloupe is, in point
of advantage, but a very small addition to our West-India
possessions; rendered many ways less valuable to
us, than it is to the French, who will probably set more
value upon it, than upon a country [Canada] that is
much more valuable to us than to them.</p>

<p>There is a great deal more to be said on all the parts
of these subjects; but as it would carry me into a detail,
that I fear would tire the patience of my readers, and
which I am not without apprehensions I have done
already, I shall reserve what remains till I dare venture

<p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> In the year 1760, upon the prospect of a peace with France, the late
Earl of Bath addressed a Letter to Two Great Men (Mr. Pitt and the
Duke of Newcastle) on the terms necessary to be insisted upon in the negociation.
He preferred the acquisition of Canada, to acquisitions in the
West Indies. In the same year there appeared Remarks on the letter addressed
to two great men, containing opposite opinions on this and other
subjects. At this moment a philosopher stepped into the controversy, and
wrote a pamphlet entitled, The Interest of Great Britain considered, with
Regard to her Colonies, &amp;c. The arguments he used, appear to have carried
weight with them at the courts of London and Paris, for Canada was
kept by the peace.
</p>
<p>
The editor thinks it necessary to add the following further explanations.&mdash;The
above piece (which first came to his hands in the shape of a
pamphlet, printed for Becket, 1761, 2d edit.) has none of the eight subdivisions
it is now thrown into, marked out by the author. He conceived
however that they might be useful, and has taken the liberty of making
them, but guards it with this apology. The better to suit his purpose, the
division of the paragraphs, &amp;c. and the italics of the original, are not
accurately adhered to. It was impossible for him however to alter one
word in the sense, style, or disposition, of his author: this was a liberty for
which he could make no apology.
</p>
<p>
In the original, the author has added his observations concerning the
Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, &amp;c. [printed in the 2d Vol.
of this work] and introduced it with the following note. "In confirmation
of the writer's opinion concerning population, manufactures, &amp;c. he has
thought it not amiss to add an extract from a piece written some years
since in America, where the facts must be well known, on which the reasonings
are founded. It is entitled, Observations, &amp;c."
</p>
<p>
With respect to the arguments used by the authors of the Letter, and
of the Remarks, it is useless to repeat them here. As far as they are
necessary for the understanding of Dr. Franklin, they are to be collected
from his own work. B.&nbsp;V.</p></div>

in his <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Observatious'">Observations</ins>
on the late and present Conduct of the French, &amp;c. printed at Boston,
1755, says,
</p>
<p>
"The Indians in the French interest are, upon all proper opportunities,
<em>instigated by their priests</em> (who have generally the chief management
of their public councils) to acts of hostility against the English, even in
time of profound peace between the two crowns. Of this there are many
undeniable instances: the war between the Indians and the colonies of
the Massachusett's Bay and New Hampshire, in 1723, by which those colonies
suffered so much damage, was begun by the instigation of the
French: their supplies were from them; and there are now original letters
of several Jesuits to be produced, whereby it evidently appears, that they
were continually animating the Indians, when almost tired with the war,
to a farther prosecution of it. The French not only excited the Indians,
and supported them, but joined their own forces with them in all the late
hostilities that have been committed within his majesty's province of Nova
Scotia. And from an intercepted letter this year from the Jesuits at Penobscot,
and from other information, it is certain, that they have been using
their utmost endeavours to excite the Indians to new acts of hostility
against his majesty's colony of the Massachusett's Bay; and some have
been committed. The French not only excite the Indians to acts of hostility,
but reward them for it, by <em>buying the English prisoners of them</em>: for the
ransom of each of which they afterwards demand of us the price that is
usually given for a slave in these colonies. They do this under the specious
pretence of rescuing the poor prisoners from the cruelties and barbarities
of the savages; but in reality to encourage them to continue their depredations,
as they can by this means get more by hunting the English,
than by hunting wild-beasts; and the French at the same time are thereby
enabled to keep up a large body of Indians, entirely at <em>the expence of the
English</em>."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> "Although the Indians live scattered, as a hunter's life requires, they
may be collected together from almost any distance; as they can find
their subsistence from their gun in their travelling. But let the number of
the Indians be what it will, they are not formidable merely on account of
their numbers; there are many other circumstances that give them a great
advantage over the English. The English inhabitants, though numerous,
are extended over a large tract of land, five hundred leagues in length on
the sea shore; and although some of their trading towns are thick settled,
their settlements in the country towns must be at a distance from each
other: besides, that in a new country where lands are cheap, people are
fond of acquiring large tracts to themselves; and therefore in the out-settlements,
they must be more remote: and as the people that move out are
generally poor, they sit down either where they can easiest procure land,
or soonest raise a subsistence. Add to this, that the English have fixed
settled habitations, the easiest and shortest passages to which the Indians,
by constantly hunting in the woods, are perfectly well acquainted with;
whereas the English know little or nothing of the Indian country, nor of
the passages through the woods that lead to it. The Indian way of making
war is by sudden attack upon exposed places; and as soon as they have
done mischief, they retire, and either go home by the same or some different
route, as they think safest; or go to some other place at a distance, to
renew their stroke. If a sufficient party should happily be ready to pursue
them, it is a great chance, whether in a country consisting of woods
and swamps, which the English are not acquainted with, the enemy do
not lie in ambush for them in some convenient place, and from thence destroy
them. If this should not be the case, but the English should pursue
them, as soon as they have gained the rivers, by means of their canoes
(to the use of which they are brought up from their infancy) they presently
get out of their reach: further, if a body of men were to march into their
country, to the place where they are settled, they can, upon the least notice,
without great disadvantage, quit their present habitation, and betake
themselves to new ones." <cite>Clark's Observations</cite>, p. 13.
</p>
<p>
"It has been already remarked, that the tribes of the Indians, living
upon the lakes and rivers that run upon the back of the English settlements
in North America, are very numerous, and can furnish a great number of
fighting men, all perfectly well acquainted with the use of arms as soon as
capable of carrying them, as they get the whole of their subsistence from
hunting; and that this army, large as it may be, can be maintained by the
French without any expence. From their numbers, their situation, and
the rivers that run into the English settlements, it is easy to conceive, that
they can at any time make an attack upon, and constantly annoy as many
of the exposed English settlements as they please, and those at any distance
from each other. The effects of such incursions have been too severely
felt by many of the British colonies, not to be very well known.
The entire breaking up places, that had been for a considerable time settled
at a great expence both of labour and money; burning the houses, destroying
the flock, killing and making prisoners great numbers of the inhabitants,
with all the cruel usage they meet with in their captivity, is only
a part of the scene. All other places that are exposed are kept in continual
terror; the lands lie waste and uncultivated, from the danger that
attends those that shall presume to work upon them: besides the immense
charge the governments must be at in a very ineffectual manner to defend
their extended frontiers; and all this from the influence the French have
had over, but comparatively, a few of the Indians. To the same or greater
evils still will every one of the colonies be exposed, whenever the same
influence shall be extended to the whole body of them." Ibid. p. 20.</p></div>

that in old settled countries, all trades, farms, offices, and employments are
full; and many people refrain marrying till they see an opening, in which
they can settle themselves, with a reasonable prospect of maintaining a family:
but in America, it being easy to obtain land, which, with moderate
labour will afford subsistence and something to spare, people marry more
readily and earlier in life, whence arises a numerous offspring and the swift
population of those countries. It is a common error, that we cannot fill
our provinces or increase the number of them, without draining this nation
of its people. The increment alone of our present colonies is sufficient for
both those purposes. [Written in 1760.]</p></div>

that no land-carriage is necessary, to go out of one into another. From
Presqu'isle on lake Erie, there are but fifteen miles land-carriage, and that

<p>
By these accounts it appears, that the exports to the West India
islands, and to the northern colonies, were in the first term nearly equal
(the difference being only 122,936<em>l.</em> 10s. 4d.) and in the second term, the
exports to those islands had only increased 404,504<em>l.</em> 2s. 1d.&mdash;Whereas
the increase to the northern colonies is 3,927,789<em>l.</em> 3s. 1d. almost <em>four
millions</em>.
</p>
<p>
Some part of this increased demand for English goods may be ascribed
to the armies and fleets we have had both in North America and the
West Indies; not so much for what is consumed by the soldiery; their
clothing, stores, ammunition, &amp;c. sent from hence on account of the government,
being (as is supposed) not included in these accounts of merchandize
exported; but, as the war has occasioned a great plenty of money
in America, many of the inhabitants have increased their expence.
</p>
<p>
N. B. These accounts do not include any exports from Scotland to
America, which are doubtless proportionally considerable; nor the exports
from Ireland.
</p>
<p>
[I shall carry on this calculation where Dr. Franklin left it. For four
years, from 1770 to 1773 inclusively, the same average <em>annual</em> exports
to the same ports of the West Indies is 994,463<em>l.</em>, and to the
same ports of the North American plantations 2,919,669<em>l.</em> But the
annual averages of the first and second terms of the former were 672,668<em>l.</em>
and 753,568<em>l.</em>: of the latter, 697,254<em>l.</em> and 1,482,811<em>l.</em>
</p>
<p>
In ten years therefore (taking the middle years of the terms) the North
American trade is found to have <em>doubled</em> the West Indian: in the next
sixteen years it becomes greater by <em>three-fold</em>.&mdash;With respect to itself, the
North American trade in 32 years (taking the extremes of the terms) has
quadrupled; while the West Indian trade increased only one half; of
which increase I apprehend Jamaica has given more than one-third, chiefly
in consequence of the quiet produced by the peace with the maroon negroes.&mdash;Had
the West Indian trade continued stationary, the North American
trade would have quadrupled with respect to it, in 26 years; and
this, notwithstanding the checks given to the latter, by their non-importation
agreements and the encouragement of their own manufactures.
</p>
<p>
There has been an accession to both these trades, produced by the cessions
at the treaty of Paris, not touched upon by Dr. Franklin. The
average <em>annual</em> export-trade, from 1770 to 1773 inclusively, to the ceded
West India islands, amounted to 258,299<em>l.</em>: to the ceded North American
territory it has been 280,423<em>l.</em> See Sir Charles Whitworth's State of
Trade. B.&nbsp;V.]</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_47_47" id="Footnote_47_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> The <em>aid</em> Dr. Franklin alludes to must probably have consisted in
early and full supplies of arms, officers, intelligence, and trade of export
and of import, through the river St. Lawrence, on risques both public and
private; in the encouragement of splendid promises and a great ally; in
the passage from Canada to the back settlements, being <em>shut</em> to the British
<em>forces</em>; in the quiet of the <em>great body</em> of Indians; in the support of
emissaries and discontented citizens; in loans and subsidies to congress,
in ways <em>profitable to France</em>; in a refuge to be granted them in case of defeat,
in vacant lands, as settlers; in the probability of war commencing
earlier between England and France, at the gulph of St. Lawrence (when
the shipping taken, were <em>rightfully</em> addressed to Frenchmen) than in the

of the sovereign had exceeded the fear of the foreigner; a circumstance
frequently seen possible in history, and which our ministers took care

This explanation would have required apology for its insertion, were
not the opinion pretty common in England, that <em>had not the French been
removed from Canada, the revolt of America never would have taken place</em>.
Why then were the French <em>not left</em> in Canada, at the peace of 1763? Or,
since they <em>were not</em> left there, why was the American dispute begun? Yet
in one sense, perhaps this opinion is true; for <em>had</em> the French been left in
Canada, ministers would not only have <em>sooner</em> felt, but <em>sooner</em> have seen, the
strange fatality of their plans. B.&nbsp;V.</p></div>

<p>In the Report of the Board of Trade, dated Feb. 9,
1764, the following reasons are given for <em>restraining the
emission</em> of paper-bills of credit in America, as <em>a legal
tender</em>.</p>

<p>1. "That it <em>carries the gold and silver out</em> of the province,
and so ruins the country; as <em>experience has
shewn</em>, in every colony where it has been practised in
any great degree.</p>

<p>2. "That the <em>merchants</em> trading to America <em>have suffered</em>
and lost by it.</p>

<p>3. "That the restriction [of it] <em>has had a beneficial
effect</em> in New England.</p>

<p>4. "That every <em>medium of trade should have an intrinsic
value</em>, which paper-money has not. Gold and
silver are therefore the fittest for this medium, as they
are an equivalent; which paper never can be.</p>

<p>5. "That <em>debtors</em> in the assemblies make paper-money
with <em>fraudulent views</em>.</p>

<p>6. "That in the middle colonies, where the credit
of the paper-money has been best supported, the bills
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
have <em>never kept to their nominal value</em> in circulation;
but have constantly depreciated to a certain degree,
whenever the quantity has been increased."</p>

<p>To consider these reasons in their order; the first is,</p>

<p>1. "<em>That paper-money</em> carries the gold and silver out
<em>of the province, and so ruins the country; as</em> experience
has shewn, <em>in every colony where it has been practised in
any great degree</em>."&mdash;This opinion, of its ruining the
country, seems to be merely speculative, or not otherwise
founded than upon misinformation in the matter
of fact. The truth is, that the balance of their trade
with Britain being greatly against them, the gold and
silver are drawn out to pay that balance; and then the
necessity of some medium of trade has induced the
making of paper-money, which could <em>not</em> be carried
away. Thus, if carrying out all the gold and silver
ruins a country, every colony was ruined before it
made paper-money.&mdash;But, far from being ruined by it,
the colonies that have made use of paper-money have
been, and are all, in a thriving condition. The debt
indeed to Britain has increased, because their numbers,
and of course their trade, have increased; for all trade
having always a proportion of debt outstanding, which
is paid in its turn, while fresh debt is contracted, the
proportion of debt naturally increases as the trade increases;
but the improvement and increase of estates
in the colonies have been in a greater proportion than
their debt. New England, particularly in 1696 (about
the time they began the use of paper-money) had in
all its four provinces but 180 churches or congregations;
in 1760 they were 530. The number of farms
and buildings there is increased in proportion to the
numbers of people; and the goods exported to them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
from England in 1750, before the restraint took place,
were near five times as much as before they had paper-money.
Pensylvania, before it made any paper-money,
was totally stript of its gold and silver; though they
had from time to time, like the neighbouring colonies,
agreed to take gold and silver coins at higher nominal
values, in hopes of drawing money into, and
retaining it, for the internal uses of the province. During
that weak practice, silver got up by degrees to 8s.
9d. per ounce, and English crowns were called six, seven,
and eight-shilling pieces, long before paper-money
was made. But this practice of increasing the
denomination was found not to answer the end. The
balance of trade carried out the gold and silver as fast as
they were brought in; the merchants raising the price
of their goods in proportion to the increased denomination
of the money. The difficulties for want of cash
were accordingly very great, the chief part of the trade
being carried on by the extremely inconvenient method
of barter; when in 1723 paper-money was first
made there; which gave new life to business, promoted
greatly the settlement of new lands (by lending
small sums to beginners on easy interest, to be repaid
by instalments) whereby the province has so greatly
increased in inhabitants, that the export from hence
thither is now more than tenfold what it then was; and
by their trade with foreign colonies, they have been
able to obtain great quantities of gold and silver to remit
hither in return for the manufactures of this country.
New York and New Jersey have also increased
greatly during the same period, with the use of paper-money;
so that it does not appear to be of the ruinous
nature ascribed to it. And if the inhabitants of those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
countries are glad to have the use of paper among
themselves, that they may thereby be enabled to spare,
for remittances hither, the gold and silver they obtain
by their commerce with foreigners; one would expect,
that no objection against their parting with it could
arise here, in the country that receives it.</p>

<p>The 2d reason is, "<em>That the</em> merchants <em>trading to
America have</em> suffered <em>and lost by the paper-money</em>."&mdash;This
may have been the case in particular instances, at
particular times and places: as in South Carolina,
about 58 years since; when the colony was thought in
danger of being destroyed by the Indians and Spaniards;
and the British merchants, in fear of losing
their whole effects there, called precipitately for remittances;
and the inhabitants, to get something lodged
in safe countries, gave any price in paper-money for
bills of exchange; whereby the paper, as compared
with bills, or with produce, or other effects fit for exportation,
was suddenly and greatly depreciated. The
unsettled state of government for a long time in that
province had also its share in depreciating its bills. But
since that danger blew over, and the colony has been
in the hands of the crown; their currency became
fixed, and has so remained to this day. Also in New
England, when much greater quantities were issued
than were necessary for a medium of trade, to defray
the expedition against Louisbourg; and, during the
last war in Virginia and North Carolina, when great
sums were issued to pay the colony troops, and the war
made tobacco a poorer remittance, from the higher
price of freight and insurance: in these cases, the merchants
trading to those colonies may sometimes have
suffered by the sudden and unforeseen rise of exchange.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
By slow and gradual rises, they seldom suffer; the
goods being sold at proportionable prices. But war is
a common calamity in all countries, and the merchants
that deal with them cannot expect to avoid a share of
the losses it sometimes occasions, by affecting public
credit. It is hoped, however, that the profits of their
subsequent commerce with those colonies may have
made them some reparation. And the merchants trading
to the middle colonies (New York, New Jersey,
and Pensylvania) have never suffered by any rise of
exchange; it having ever been a constant rule there,
to consider British debts as payable in Britain, and not
to be discharged but by as much paper (whatever
might be the rate of exchange) as would purchase a
bill for the full sterling sum. On the contrary, the
merchants have been great gainers by the use of paper-money
in those colonies; as it enabled them to send
much greater quantities of goods, and the purchasers
to pay more punctually for them. And the people
there make no complaint of any injury done them by
paper-money, with a legal tender; they are sensible of
its benefits; and petition to have it so allowed.</p>

<p>The 3d reason is, "<em>That the</em> restriction <em>has had a</em>
beneficial effect <em>in New England</em>." Particular circumstances
in the New England colonies made paper-money
less necessary and less convenient to them. They
have great and valuable fisheries of whale and cod, by
which large remittances can be made. They are four
distinct governments; but having much mutual intercourse
of dealings, the money of each used to pass current
in all: but the whole of this common currency not
being under one common direction, was not so easily
kept within due bounds; the prudent reserve of one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
colony in its emissions being rendered useless by excess
in another. The Massachusets, therefore, were
not dissatisfied with the restraint, as it restrained their
neighbours as well as themselves; and perhaps <em>they</em> do
not desire to have the act repealed. They have not
yet felt much inconvenience from it; as they were enabled
to abolish their paper-currency, by a large sum
in silver from Britain to reimburse their expences in
taking Louisbourg, which, with the gold brought from
Portugal, by means of their fish, kept them supplied
with a currency; till the late war furnished them and
all America with bills of exchange; so that little cash
was needed for remittance. Their fisheries too furnish
them with remittance through Spain and Portugal to
England; which enables them the more easily to retain
gold and silver in their country. The middle colonies
have not this advantage; nor have they tobacco;
which in Virginia and Maryland answers the same
purpose. When colonies are so different in their circumstances,
a regulation, that is not inconvenient to
one or a few, may be very much so to the rest. But
the pay is now become so indifferent in New England,
at least in some of its provinces, through the want of
currency, that the trade thither is at present under
great discouragement.</p>

<p>The 4th reason is, "<em>That every</em> medium of trade
<em>should have an</em> intrinsic value; <em>which paper-money has
not</em>. <em>Gold and silver are therefore the fittest for this medium,
as they are an equivalent; which paper never can
be."</em> However fit a particular thing may be for a particular
purpose; wherever that thing is not to be had, or
not to be had in sufficient quantity; it becomes necessary
to use something else, the fittest that can be got, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
lieu of it. Gold and silver are not the produce of North
America, which has no mines; and that which is
brought thither cannot be kept there in sufficient quantity
for a currency. Britain, an independent great
state, when its inhabitants grow too fond of the expensive
luxuries of foreign countries, that draw away its
money, can, and frequently does, make laws to discourage
or prohibit such importations; and by that means
can retain its cash. The <em>colonies</em> are dependent governments;
and their people having naturally great respect
for the sovereign country, and being thence immoderately
fond of its modes, manufactures, and superfluities,
cannot be restrained from purchasing them by any
province law; because such law, if made, would immediately
be repealed here, as prejudicial to the trade and
interest of Britain. It seems hard therefore, to draw all,
their real money from them, and then refuse them the
poor privilege of using paper instead of it. Bank bills
and bankers notes are daily used <em>here</em> as a medium of
trade, and in large dealings perhaps the greater part is
transacted by their means; and yet <em>they</em> have no intrinsic
value, but rest on the credit of those that issue
them; as paper-bills in the colonies do on the credit of
the respective governments there. Their being payable
in cash upon sight by the drawer is indeed a circumstance
that cannot attend the colony bills; for the
reasons just above-mentioned; their cash being drawn
from them by the British trade; but the legal tender
being substituted in its place is rather a greater advantage
to the possessor; since he need not be at the trouble
of going to a <em>particular bank</em> or banker to demand
the money, finding (wherever he has occasion to lay
out money in the province) a person that is obliged to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
take the bills. So that even out of the province, the
knowledge, that every man within that province is
obliged to take its money, gives the bills a credit among
its neighbours, nearly equal to what they have at home.</p>

<p>And were it not for the laws <em>here</em>, that restrain or
prohibit as much as possible all losing trades, the cash
of <em>this</em> country would soon be exported: every merchant,
who had occasion to remit it, would run to the bank
with all its bills, that came into his hands, and take out
his part of its treasure for that purpose; so that in a
short time, it would be no more able to pay bills in money
upon sight, than it is now in the power of a colony
treasury so to do. And if government afterwards
should have occasion for the credit of the bank, it must
of necessity make its bills a legal tender; funding them
however on taxes by which they may in time be paid
off; as has been the general practice in the colonies.&mdash;At
this very time, even the silver-money in England is
obliged to the legal tender for part of its value; that
part which is the difference between its real weight and
its denomination. Great part of the shillings and sixpences
now current are, by wearing, become five, ten,
twenty, and some of the sixpences even fifty per cent.
too light. For this difference between the <em>real</em> and the
<em>nominal</em>, you have no <em>intrinsic</em> value; you have not so
much as paper, you have nothing. It is the legal tender,
with the knowledge that it can easily be repassed
for the same value, that makes three-pennyworth of silver
pass for sixpence. Gold and silver have undoubtedly
<em>some</em> properties that give them a fitness above paper,
as a medium of exchange; particularly their <em>universal
estimation</em>; especially in cases where a country
has occasion to carry its money abroad, either as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
stock to trade with, or to purchase <em>allies</em> and <em>foreign succours</em>.
Otherwise, that very universal estimation is an
inconvenience, which paper-money is free from; since
it tends to deprive a country of even the quantity of
currency that should be retained as a necessary instrument
of its internal commerce, and obliges it to be continually
on its guard in making and executing, at a
great expence, the laws that are to prevent the trade
which exports it. Paper-money well funded has another
great advantage over gold and silver; its lightness
of carriage, and the little room that is occupied by a
great sum; whereby it is capable of being more easily,
and more safely, because more privately, conveyed from
place to place. Gold and silver are not <em>intrinsically</em> of
equal value with iron, a metal in itself capable of many
more beneficial uses to mankind. Their value rests
chiefly in the estimation they happen to be in among
the generality of nations, and the credit given to the
opinion, that that estimation will continue. Otherwise
a pound of gold would not be a real equivalent for even
a bushel of wheat. Any other well-founded credit, is
as much an equivalent as gold and silver; and in some
cases more so, or it would not be preferred by commercial
people in different countries. Not to mention
again our own bank bills; Holland, which understands
the value of cash as well as any people in the world,
would never part with gold and silver for credit (as they
do when they put it into their bank, from whence little
of it is ever afterwards drawn out) if they did not think
and find the credit a full equivalent.</p>

<p>The 5th reason is, "<em>That</em> debtors <em>in the assemblies
make paper-money</em> with fraudulent views." This is often
said by the adversaries of paper-money, and if it has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
been the case in any particular colony, that colony
should, on proof of the fact, be duly punished. This,
however, would be no reason for punishing other colonies,
who have <em>not</em> so abused their legislative powers.
To deprive all the colonies of the convenience of paper-money,
because it has been charged on some of them,
that they have made it an instrument of fraud, is as if
all the India, Bank, and other stocks and trading companies
were to be abolished, because there have been,
once in an age, Mississippi and South-Sea schemes and
bubbles.</p>

<p>The 6th and last reason is, "<em>That in the middle colonies,
where the paper-money has been best supported, the
bills have</em> never kept to their nominal value <em>in circulation;
but have constantly depreciated to a certain degree,
whenever the quantity has been increased</em>." If the rising
of the value of any particular commodity wanted for
exportation, is to be considered as a depreciation of the
values of <em>whatever remains</em> in the country; then the rising
of silver above paper to that height of additional
value, which its capability of exportation only gave it,
may be called a depreciation of the paper. Even here,
as bullion has been wanted or not wanted for exportation,
its price has varied from 5<em>s.</em> 2<em>d.</em> to 5<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> per
ounce. This is near 10 per cent. But was it ever said
or thought on such an occasion, that all the bank bills,
and all the coined silver, and all the gold in the kingdom,
were depreciated 10 per cent? Coined silver is
now wanted here for change, and 1 per cent is given
for it by some bankers: are gold and bank notes therefore
depreciated 1 per cent.? The fact in the middle colonies
is really this: on the emission of the first paper-money,
a difference soon arose between that and silver;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the latter having a property the former had not, a property
always in demand in the colonies; to wit, its
being fit for a remittance. This property having soon
found its value, by the merchants bidding on one another
for it, and a dollar thereby coming to be rated at
8<em>s.</em> in paper-money of New York, and 7<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> in paper
of Pensylvania, it has continued uniformly at those rates
in both provinces now near forty years, without any variation
upon new emissions; though, in Pensylvania,
the paper-currency has at times increased from 15,000<em>l.</em>
the first sum, to 600,000<em>l.</em> or near it. Nor has any
alteration been occasioned by the paper-money, in the
price of the necessaries of life, when compared with silver:
they have been for the greatest part of the time no
higher than before it was emitted; varying only by
plenty and scarcity, or by a less or greater foreign demand.
It has indeed been usual with the adversaries
of a paper-currency, to call every rise of exchange with
London, a depreciation of the paper: but this notion
appears to be by no means just: for if the paper purchases
every thing but bills of exchange, at the former
rate, and these bills are not above one-tenth of what is
employed in purchases; then it may be more properly
and truly said, that the exchange has risen, than that
the paper has depreciated. And as a proof of this, it is
a certain fact, that whenever in those colonies bills of
exchange have been dearer, the purchaser has been constantly
obliged to give more in silver, as well as in paper,
for them; the silver having gone hand in hand
with the paper at the rate above-mentioned; and therefore
it might as well have been said, that the silver was
depreciated.</p>

<p>There have been several different schemes for furnishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the colonies with paper-money, that should <em>not</em>
be a legal tender, viz.</p>

<p>1. <em>To form a bank, in imitation of the bank of England,
with a sufficient stock of cash</em> to pay the bills on
sight.</p>

<p>This has been often proposed, but appears impracticable,
under the present circumstances of the colony-trade;
which, as is said above, draws all the cash to
Britain, and would soon strip the bank.</p>

<p>2. <em>To raise a fund by some yearly tax, securely lodged
in the bank of England as it arises, which should</em> (during
the term of years <em>for which the paper-bills are to be current</em>)
<em>accumulate to a sum sufficient to discharge them all
at their</em> original value.</p>

<p>This has been tried in Maryland: and the bills so
funded were issued without being made a general legal
tender. The event was, that as notes payable in time
are naturally subject to a discount proportioned to the
time: so these bills fell at the beginning of the term so
low, as that twenty pounds of them became worth no
more than twelve pounds in Pensylvania, the next
neighbouring province; though both had been struck
near the same time at the same nominal value, but the
latter was supported by the general legal tender. The
Maryland bills however began to rise as the term shortened,
and towards the end recovered their full value.
But, as a depreciating currency injures creditors, <em>this</em>
injured debtors; and by its continually changing value,
appears unfit for the purpose of money, which should
be as fixed as possible in its own value; because it is
to be the measure of the value of other things.</p>

<p>3. <em>To make the bills</em> carry an interest <em>sufficient to support
their value</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>This too has been tried in some of the New England
colonies; but great inconveniencies were found to attend
it. The bills, to fit them for a currency, are made
of various denominations, and some very low, for the
sake of change; there are of them from 10<em>l.</em> down to 3<em>d.</em>
When they first come abroad, they pass easily, and answer
the purpose well enough for a few months; but
as soon as the interest becomes worth computing, the
calculation of it on every little bill in a sum between the
dealer and his customers, in shops, warehouses and markets,
takes up much time, to the great hindrance of
business. This evil, however, soon gave place to a
worse; for the bills were in a short time gathered up
and hoarded; it being a very tempting advantage to
have money bearing interest, and the principal all the
while in a man's power, ready for bargains that may
offer; which money out on mortgage is not. By this
means numbers of people became usurers with small
sums, who could not have found persons to take such
sums of them upon interest, giving good security; and
would therefore not have thought of it; but would rather
have employed the money in some business, if it
had been money of the common kind. Thus trade, instead
of being increased by such bills, is diminished;
and by their being shut up in chests, the very end of
making them (viz. to furnish a medium of commerce)
is in a great measure, if not totally defeated.</p>

<p>On the whole, no method has hitherto been formed
to establish a medium of trade, in lieu of money, equal
in all its advantages, to bills of credit&mdash;funded on sufficient
taxes for discharging it, or on land-security of
double the value for repaying it at the end of the term;
and in the mean time, made a <span class="xs lsp2">GENERAL LEGAL TENDER.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
The experience of now near half a century in
the middle colonies has convinced them of it among
themselves; by the great increase of their settlements,
numbers, buildings, improvements, agriculture, shipping,
and commerce. And the same experience has satisfied
the British merchants, who trade thither, that it has
been greatly useful to them, and not in a single instance
prejudicial.</p>

<p>It is therefore hoped, that securing the full discharge
of British debts, which are payable here, and in all justice
and reason ought to be fully discharged here in
sterling money; the restraint on the legal tender within
the colonies will be taken off; at least for those colonies
that desire it, and where the merchants trading to
them make no objection to it<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.</p>

and unusual trade to America, in consequence of the great fleets
and armies on foot there, and the clandestine dealings with the enemy,
who were cut off from their own supplies. This made great debts. The
briskness of the trade ceasing with the war, the merchants were anxious
for payment, which occasioned some confusion in the colonies, and stirred
up a clamour here against paper-money. The board of trade, of which
lord Hilsborough was the chief, joined in this opposition to paper-money,
as appears by the report. Dr. Franklin being asked to draw up an answer

<h3 class="negidt1"><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>To the Freemen of Pensylvania, on the Subject of a particular Militia-Bill,
rejected by the Proprietor's Deputy or Governor.</em></a></h3>


<p class="right padr2"><em>Philadelphia, Sept. 28, 1764.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Gentlemen,</p>

<p>Your desire of knowing how the militia-bill came
to fail in the last assembly shall immediately be complied
with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>As the governor pressed hard for a militia-law to secure
the internal peace of the province, and the people
of this country had not been accustomed to militia service;
the house, to make it more generally agreeable
to the freeholders, formed the bill so as that they might
have some share in the election of the officers; to secure
them from having absolute strangers set over them,
or persons generally disagreeable.</p>

<p>This was no more, than that every company should
choose, and recommend to the governor, three persons
for each office of captain, lieutenant, and ensign; <em>out
of which three</em>, the governor was to commission <em>one</em>, that
he thought most proper, or which he pleased, to be the
officer. And that the captains, lieutenants, and ensigns,
so commissioned by the governor, should, in their
respective regiments, choose and recommend three persons
for each office of colonel, lieutenant-colonel, and
major; out of which three the governor was to commission
<em>one</em>, whichever he pleased, to each of the said
offices.</p>

<p>The governor's amendment to the bill in this particular
was, to strike out wholly this privilege of the people,
and take to himself the <em>sole</em> appointment of all the
officers.</p>

<p>The next amendment was to aggravate and <em>enhance
all the fines</em>. A fine, that the assembly had made one
hundred pounds, and thought heavy enough, the governor
required to be three hundred pounds. What
they had made fifty pounds, he required to be one hundred
and fifty. These were fines on the commissioned
officers for disobedience to his commands; but the
non-commissioned officers, or common soldiers, whom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
for the same offence, the assembly proposed to fine at
ten pounds, the governor insisted should be fined fifty
pounds.</p>

<p>These fines, and some others to be mentioned hereafter,
the assembly thought ruinously high: but when,
in a subsequent amendment, the governor would, for
offences among the militia, take away the <em>trial by jury</em>
in the common courts; and required, that the trial
should be by a court-martial, composed of officers of
his own sole appointing, who should have power of sentencing
even to death; the house could by no means
consent thus to give up their constituents' liberty, estate,
and life itself, into the absolute power of a proprietary
governor; and so the bill failed.</p>

<p>That you may be assured I do not misrepresent this
matter, I shall give you the last-mentioned amendment
(so called) at full length; and for the truth and exactness
of my copy I dare appeal to Mr. Secretary
Shippen.</p>

<p>The words of the bill, p. 43, were, "Every such person,
so offending, being legally convicted thereof, &amp;c."
By the words <em>legally convicted</em>, was intended a conviction
after legal trial, in the common course of the laws
of the land. But the governor required this addition
immediately to follow the words ["convicted thereof"]
viz. 'by a court-martial, shall suffer <span class="xs lsp2">DEATH</span>, or such
other punishment as such court, by their sentence or
decree, shall think proper to inflict and pronounce.
And be it farther enacted by the authority aforesaid,
That when and so often as it may be necessary, the governor
and commander in chief for the time being
shall appoint and commissionate, under the great seal
of this province, sixteen commissioned officers in each
regiment; with authority and power to them, or any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
thirteen of them, to hold courts-martial, of whom a
field-officer shall always be one, and president of the
said court; and such courts-martial shall, and are
hereby impowered to administer an oath to any witness,
in order to the examination or trial of any of the
offences which by this act are made cognizable in such
courts, and shall come before them. Provided always,
that in all trials by a court-martial by virtue of this act,
every officer present at such trial, before any proceedings
be had therein, shall take an <em>oath</em> upon the holy
evangelists, before one justice of the peace in the
county where such court is held, who are hereby authorized
to administer the same, in the following words,
that is to say, "I A. B. do swear, that I will duly administer
justice according to evidence, and to the directions
of an act, entitled, An act for forming and regulating
the militia of the province of Pensylvania,
without partiality, favour, or affection; and that I will
not divulge the sentence of the court, until it shall be
approved of by the governor or commander in chief of
this province for the time being; neither will I, upon
any account, at any time whatsoever, disclose or <em>discover
the vote or opinion</em> of any particular member of the
court-martial. So help me God."&mdash;And no sentence
of death, or other sentence shall be given against any
offender but by the concurrence of nine of the officers
so sworn. And no sentence, passed against any offender
by such court-martial, shall be put in execution, until
report be made of the whole proceedings to the governor
or commander in chief of this province for the time
being, and his directions signified thereupon.'</p>

<p>It is observable here, that by the common course of
justice, a man is to be tried by a jury of his neighbours
and fellows; impannelled by a sheriff, in whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
appointment the people have a choice: the prisoner too
has a right to challenge twenty of the pannel, without
giving a reason, and as many more as he can give reasons
for challenging; and before he can be convicted,
the jury are to be unanimous; they are all to agree that
he is guilty, and are therefore all accountable for their
verdict. But by this amendment, the jury (if they may
be so called) are all officers of the governor's sole appointing,
and not one of them can be challenged; and
though a common militia-man is to be tried, no common
militia-man shall be of that Jury; and so far from
requiring all to agree, a bare majority shall be sufficient
to condemn you. And lest that majority should be
under any check or restraint, from an apprehension of
what the world might think or say of the severity or
injustice of their sentence, an oath is to be taken,
never to discover the vote or opinion of any particular
member!</p>

<p>These are some of the chains attempted to be forged
for you by the proprietary faction! Who advised the
g&mdash;&mdash;r is not difficult to know. They are the very
men, who now clamour at the assembly for a proposal
of bringing the trial of a particular murder to this
county, from another, where it was not thought safe for
any man to be either juryman or witness; and call it
disfranchising the people! who are now bawling about
the constitution, and pretending vast concern for your
liberties! In refusing you the least means of recommending
or expressing your regard for persons to be
placed over you as officers, and who were thus to be
made your judges in life and estate; they have not regarded
the example of the king, our wise, as well as
kind master, who, in all his requisitions made to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
colonies, of raising troops for their defence, directed,
that "the better to facilitate the important service, the
commissions should be given to such as from their
weight and credit with the people may be best enabled
to effectuate the levies<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>." In establishing a militia for
the defence of the province, how could the "weight
and credit" of men with the people be better discovered,
than by the mode that bill directed; viz. by a majority
of those that were to be commanded nominating three
for each office to the governor, of which three he might
take the one he liked best?</p>

<p>However, the courts-martial being established, and
all of us thus put into his honour's absolute power, the
governor goes on to enhance the fines and penalties;
thus, in page 49 of the bill, where the assembly had
proposed the fine to be ten shillings, the governor required
it to be ten pounds: in page 50, where a fine of
five pounds was mentioned, the governor's amendment
required it to be made fifty pounds. And in page 44,
where the assembly had said, "shall forfeit and pay any
sum not exceeding five pounds," the governor's amendment
says, "shall suffer <span class="xs lsp2">DEATH</span>, or such other punishment,
as shall, according to the nature of the offence,
be inflicted by the sentence of a court-martial!"</p>

<p>The assembly's refusing to admit of these amendments
in that bill is one of their offences against the
Lord Proprietary; for which that faction are now abusing
them in both the languages<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> of the province, with
all the virulence that reverend malice can dictate; enforced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
by numberless barefaced falshoods, that only the
most dishonest and base would dare to invent, and none
but the most weak and credulous can possibly believe.</p>

Government</em></a><a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59].</a></h3>

<p>It is not merely because Mr. Dickinson's speech was
ushered into the world by a preface, that one is made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
to this of Mr. Galloway. But as, in that preface, a
number of aspersions were thrown on our assemblies,
and their proceedings grossly misrepresented, it was
thought necessary to wipe those aspersions off by some
proper animadversions, and by a true state of facts, to
rectify those misrepresentations.</p>

<p>The preface begins with saying, "That governor
Denny (whose administration will never be mentioned
but with disgrace in the annals of this province) was
induced, by considerations to which the world is now
no stranger, to pass sundry acts," &amp;c. thus insinuating,
that by some unusual base bargain, secretly made, but
afterwards discovered, he was induced to pass them.</p>

<p>It is fit therefore, without undertaking to justify all
that governor's administration, to show <em>what</em> those considerations
were. Ever since the revenue of the quit-rents
first, and after that, the revenue of tavern-licences,
were settled irrevocably on our proprietors and governors,
they have looked on those incomes as their proper
estate, for which they were under no obligations to
the people: and when they afterwards concurred in
passing any useful laws, they considered them as so
many jobs, for which they ought to be particularly
paid. Hence arose the custom of <em>presents</em> twice a year
to the governors, at the close of each session in which
laws were passed, given at the time of passing: they
usually amounted to a thousand pounds per annum.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
But when the governors and assemblies disagreed, so
that laws were not passed, the presents were withheld.
When a disposition to agree ensued, there sometimes
still remained some <em>diffidence</em>. The governors would not
pass the laws that were wanted, without being sure of
the money, even all that they called their arrears; nor
the assemblies give the money, without being sure of
the laws. Thence the necessity of some private conference,
in which mutual assurances of good faith
might be received and given, that the transactions
should go hand in hand. What name the impartial
reader will give to this kind of commerce, I cannot say:
to me it appears an extortion of more money from the
people, for that to which they had before an undoubted
right, both by the constitution and by purchase; but
there was no other shop they could go to for the commodity
they wanted, and they were obliged to comply.
Time established the custom, and made it seem honest;
so that our governors, even those of the most
undoubted honour, have practised it. Governor Thomas,
after a long misunderstanding with the assembly,
went more openly to work with them in managing this
commerce, and they with him. The fact is curious, as
it stands recorded in the votes of 1742-3. Sundry bills,
sent up to the governor for his assent, had lain long in
his hands, without any answer. Jan. 4, the house
"ordered, that Thomas Leech and Edward Warner
wait upon the governor, and acquaint him, that the
house had long waited for his result on the bills that
lie before him, and desire to know, when they may expect
it:" the gentlemen return, and report, "that they
waited upon the governor, and delivered the message
of the house according to order; and that the governor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
was pleased to say, he had had the bills long under
consideration, and <em>waited the result</em> of the <em>house</em>." The
house well understood this hint; and immediately resolved
into a committee of the whole house, to take
what was called <em>the governor's support</em> into consideration;
in which they made (the minutes say) <em>some progress</em>;
and the next morning it appears, that that <em>progress</em>,
whatever it was, had been communicated to
him; for he sent them down this message by his secretary:
"Mr. Speaker, the governor commands me to
acquaint you, that as he has received assurances of a
<em>good disposition</em> in the house, he thinks it incumbent on
him to show <em>the like</em> on his part; and therefore sends
down the bills which lay before him, without any
amendment." As this message only showed a good
disposition, but contained no promise to pass the bills,
the house seem to have had their doubts; and therefore,
February 2, when they came to resolve, on the
report of the grand committee, to give the money,
they guarded their resolves very cautiously, viz. "Resolved,
that <em>on the passage</em> of such bills as now lie before
the governor, (the naturalization bill, and such other
bills as may be presented to him during this sitting)
there be <span class="xs lsp2">PAID</span> him the sum of <em>five hundred pounds</em>. Resolved
also, that on the passage of such bills as now lie
before the governor (the naturalization bill, and such
other bills as may be presented to him this sitting) there
be <span class="xs lsp2">PAID</span> to the governor the <em>further</em> sum of <em>one thousand
pounds</em>, for the current year's support; and that
orders be drawn on the treasurer and trustees of the
loan-office, pursuant to these resolves." The orders
were accordingly drawn; with which being acquainted,
he appointed a time to pass the bills; which was done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
with one hand, while he received the orders in the
other: and then with the utmost politeness [he] thanked
the house for the fifteen hundred pounds, as if it had
been a pure free gift, and a mere mark of their respect
and affection. "I <em>thank you</em>, gentlemen (says he) for
this instance of <em>your regard</em>; which I am the more
pleased with, as it gives an agreeable prospect of <em>future
harmony</em> between me and the representatives of the people."
This, reader, is an exact <em>counterpart</em> of the transaction
with governor Denny; except that Denny sent
word to the house, that he would pass the bills <em>before</em>
they voted the support. And yet <em>here</em> was no proprietary
clamour about bribery, &amp;c. And why so? Why
at that time the proprietary family, by virtue of a <em>secret
bond</em> they had obtained of the governor at his appointment,
were to <em>share with</em> him the sums so obtained of
the people!</p>

<p>This reservation of the proprietaries they were at
that time a little ashamed of; and therefore such bonds
were then to be secrets. But as, in every kind of sinning,
frequent repetition lessens shame, and increases
boldness, we find the proprietaries ten years afterwards
openly insisting on these advantages to themselves, <em>over
and above</em> what was paid to their deputy: "Wherefore
(say they) on this occasion it is necessary that we should
inform the people, through yourselves their representatives,
that as by the constitution <em>our consent is necessary</em>
to their <em>laws</em>, at the same time that they have an <em>undoubted
right</em> to such as are necessary for the defence
and real service of the country; so it will tend the better
to facilitate the several matters which must be transacted
with us, for their representatives to show a regard
<em>to us</em> and our <em>interest</em>." This was in their answer to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
representation of the assembly [Votes, December, 1754,
p. 48.] on the justice of their contributing to Indian
expences, which they had refused. And on this clause
the committee make the following remark: "They tell
us their consent is necessary to our laws, and that it
will tend the better to facilitate the matters which must
be transacted with them, for the representatives to show
a regard to their <em>interest</em>: that is (as we understand it)
though the proprietaries have a deputy here, supported
by the province, who is, or ought to be, fully impowered
to pass all laws necessary for the service of the
country; yet, before we can obtain such laws, we must
facilitate their passage by paying money for the proprietaries,
which they ought to pay; or in some shape
make it their particular <em>interest</em> to pass them. We
hope, however, that if this practice has ever been begun,
it will never be continued in this province; and
that since, as this very paragraph allows, we have an
undoubted right to such laws, we shall always be able
to obtain them from the goodness of our sovereign,
without going to market for them to a subject." Time
has shown, that those hopes were vain; they have been
obliged to go to that market ever since, directly or indirectly,
or go without their laws. The practice has
continued, and will continue, as long as the proprietary
government subsists, intervening between the
crown and the people.</p>

<p>Do not, my courteous reader, take pet at our proprietary
constitution, for these our bargain and sale proceedings
in legislation. It is a happy country where
justice, and what was your own before, can be had for
ready money. It is another addition to the value of
money, and of course another spur to industry. Every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
land is not so blessed. There are countries where the
princely proprietor claims to be lord of all property;
where what is your own shall not only be wrested from
you, but the money you give to have it restored shall
be kept with it; and your offering so much, being a
sign of your being too rich, you shall be plundered of
every thing that remained. These times are not come
here yet: your present proprietors have never been
more unreasonable hitherto, than barely to insist on
your fighting in defence of <em>their</em> property, and paying
the expence yourselves; or if their estates must [ah!
<em>must</em>] be taxed towards it, that the <em>best</em> of their lands
shall be taxed no higher than the <em>worst</em> of yours.</p>

<p>Pardon this digression, and I return to governor
Denny; but first let me do governor Hamilton the justice
to observe, that whether from the uprightness of
his own disposition, or from the odious light the practice
had been set in on Denny's account, or from both;
he did not attempt these bargains, but passed such laws
as he thought fit to pass, without any <em>previous</em> stipulation
of pay for them. But then, when he saw the assembly
tardy in the payment he expected, and yet calling
upon him still to pass more laws; he openly put
them in mind of the money, as a <em>debt</em> due to him from
custom. "In the course of the present year (says he, in
his message of July 8, 1763) a great deal of public business
hath been transacted by me, and I believe as
many useful laws enacted, as by any of my predecessors
in the same space of time: yet I have not understood
that any allowance hath hitherto been made to
me for my support, as hath been customary in this province."
The house having then some bills in hand,
took the matter into immediate consideration, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
voted him five hundred pounds, for which an order or
certificate was accordingly drawn: and on the same
day the speaker, after the house had been with the governor,
reported, "That his honour had been pleased
to give his assent to the bills, by enacting the same into
laws. And Mr. Speaker farther reported, That he had
then, in behalf of the house, presented their certificate
of five hundred pounds to the governor, who was
pleased to say, he was obliged to the house for the
same." Thus we see the practice of purchasing and
paying for laws is interwoven with our proprietary constitution,
used in the best times, and under the best governors.
And yet, alas! poor assembly! how will you
steer your brittle bark between these rocks? If you pay
<em>ready money</em> for your laws, and those laws are not liked
by the proprietaries, you are charged with bribery and
corruption: if you wait a while before you pay, you are
accused of detaining the governor's customary right,
and dunned as a negligent or dishonest debtor, that refuses
to discharge a just debt!</p>

<p>But governor Denny's case, I shall be told, differs
from all these; for the acts he was induced to pass
were, as the prefacer tell us, "<em>contrary to his duty, and
to every tie of honour and justice</em>." Such is the imperfection
of our language, and perhaps of all other languages,
that, notwithstanding we are furnished with
dictionaries innumerable, we cannot precisely know the
import of words, unless we know of what party the man
is that uses them. In the mouth of an assembly-man,
or true Pensylvanian, "contrary to his duty and to
every tie of honour and justice" would mean, the governor's
long refusal to pass laws, however just and necessary,
for taxing the proprietary estate: a refusal, contrary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to the trust reposed in the lieutenant-governor by
the royal charter, to the rights of the people, whose
welfare it was his duty to promote, and to the nature
of the contract made between the governor and
the governed, when the quit-rents and licence-fees
were established, which confirmed what the proprietaries
call our "undoubted right" to necessary
laws. But in the mouth of the proprietaries, or their
creatures, "contrary to his duty, and to every tie of
justice and honour" means, his passing laws contrary
to proprietary instructions, and contrary to the bonds
he had previously given to observe those instructions:
instructions however, that were unjust and unconstitutional;
and bonds, that were illegal and void from the
beginning.</p>

<p>Much has been said of the wickedness of governor
Denny in passing, and of the assembly in prevailing
with him to pass, those acts. By the prefacer's account
of them, you would think the laws, so obtained,
were <em>all</em> bad; for he speaks of but <em>seven</em>, of which, six,
he says, were repealed, and the seventh reported to be
"fundamentally <em>wrong</em> and <em>unjust</em>," "and ought to be
repealed, <em>unless</em> six certain amendments were made
therein<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>." Whereas in fact there were <em>nineteen</em> of
them, and several of those must have been good laws,
for even the proprietaries did not object to them. Of
the eleven that they opposed, only six were repealed;
so that it seems, these good gentlemen may themselves
be sometimes as wrong in opposing, as the assembly in
enacting laws. But the words, "fundamentally <em>wrong</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and <em>unjust</em>," are the great fund of triumph to the proprietaries
and their partizans. These, their subsequent
governors have unmercifully dinned in the ears of the
assembly on all occasions ever since; for they make a
part of near a dozen of their messages. They have rung
the changes on those words, till they worked them up
to say, that the law was fundamentally wrong and unjust
in <em>six several articles</em> (Governor's Message, May 17,
1764) instead of "ought to be repealed, <em>unless</em> six alterations
or amendments could be made therein." A law,
unjust in six several articles, must be an unjust law
indeed. Let us therefore, once for all, <em>examine</em> this unjust
law, article by article, in order to see, whether our
assemblies have been such villains as they have been
represented.</p>

<p>The <em>first</em> particular in which their lordships proposed
the act should be amended was, "That the real estates
to be taxed, be <em>defined with precision</em>; so as not to include
the unsurveyed waste land belonging to the proprietaries."
This was at most but an <em>obscurity</em> to be
cleared up. And though the law might well appear to
their lordships uncertain in that particular, with us,
who better know our own customs, and that the proprietaries
waste unsurveyed land was never here considered
among estates real, subject to taxation; there
was not the least doubt or supposition, that such lands
were included in the words "all estates, real and personal."
The agents therefore, knowing that the assembly
had no intention to tax those lands, might well
suppose they would readily agree to remove the obscurity.
Before we go farther, let it be observed, that the
main design of the proprietaries in opposing this act
was, to <em>prevent their estates being taxed at all</em>. But as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
they knew, that the doctrine of proprietary exemption,
which they had endeavoured to enforce here, could not
be supported there<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>, they bent their whole strength
against the act on <em>other</em> principles to procure its repeal,
pretending great willingness to submit to an equitable
tax; but that the assembly (out of mere malice, because
they had conscientiously quitted quakerism for the
church!) were wickedly determined to ruin them, to
tax all their unsurveyed wilderness-lands, and at the
highest rates: and by that means exempt themselves
and the people, and throw the whole burden of the war
on the proprietary family. How foreign these charges
were from the truth, need not be told to any man in
Pensylvania. And as the proprietors knew, that the
hundred thousand pounds of paper-money, struck for
the defence of <em>their</em> enormous estates, with others, was
actually issued, spread through the country, and in the
hands of thousands of poor people, who had given their
labour for it; how base, cruel, and inhuman it was to
endeavour, by a repeal of the act, to strike the money
dead in those hands at one blow, and reduce it all to
waste paper, to the utter confusion of all trade and
dealings, and the ruin of multitudes, merely to avoid
paying their own just tax&mdash;Words may be wanting to
express,&mdash;but minds will easily conceive,&mdash;and never
without abhorrence!</p>

<p>The <em>second</em> amendment proposed by their lordships
was, "That the located uncultivated lands, belonging
to the proprietaries, shall not be assessed higher than
the <em>lowest</em> rate, at which any located uncultivated lands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
belonging to the inhabitants shall be assessed." Had
there been any provision in the act, that the proprietaries'
lands, and those of the people, of the same value,
should be taxed differently, the one high, and the other
low; the act might well have been called in this particular
fundamentally wrong and unjust. But as there is
no such clause, this cannot be one of the particulars on
which the charge is founded; but, like the first, is
merely a requisition to make the act <em>clear</em>, by express
directions therein, that the proprietaries' estate should
not be, as they pretended to believe it would be, taxed
higher in proportion to its value than the estates of
others. As to their present claim, founded on that article,
"that the best and most valuable of their lands,
should be taxed no higher than the worst and least valuable
of the people's," it was not <em>then</em> thought of; they
made no such demand; nor did any one dream that so
iniquitous a claim would ever be made by men, who
had the least pretence to the characters of honourable
and honest.</p>

<p>The <em>third</em> particular was, "That all lands, <em>not granted</em>
by the proprietaries <em>within boroughs and towns</em>, be deemed
located uncultivated lands, and rated accordingly; and
not as lots." The clause in the act that this relates to
is, "And whereas many valuable lots of ground within
the city of Philadelphia, and the several boroughs and
towns within this province, remain unimproved; Be it
enacted, &amp;c. That <em>all</em> such unimproved lots of ground
within the city and boroughs aforesaid, shall be rated
and assessed according to their situation and value for,
and towards raising the money hereby granted." The
reader will observe, that the word is, <em>all</em> unimproved
lots; and that <em>all</em> comprehends the lots belonging to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the people, as well as those of the proprietary. There
were many of the former; and a number belonging
even to members of the then assembly; and considering
the value, the tax must be proportionably as grievous
to them, as the proprietary's to him. Is there
among us a single man, even a proprietary relation,
officer, or dependant, so insensible of the differences of
right and wrong, and so confused in his notions of just
and unjust, as to think and say, that the act in this particular
was fundamentally wrong and unjust? I believe
not one. What then could their lordships mean by the
proposed amendment? Their meaning is easily explained.
The proprietaries have considerable tracts of
land within the bounds of boroughs and towns, that
have not yet been divided into lots: they pretended to
believe, that by virtue of this clause an imaginary division
would be made of <em>those</em> lands into lots, and an extravagant
value set on such imaginary lots, greatly to
their prejudice. It was answered, that no such thing
was intended by the act: and that by lots was meant
only such ground as <em>had</em> been surveyed and divided
into lots, and not the open undivided lands. If this
only is intended, say their lordships, then let the act be
amended, so as <em>clearly</em> to express what is intended.
This is the full amount of the third particular. How
the act was understood here, is well known by the execution
of it before the dispute came on in England, and
therefore before their lordships' opinion on the point
could be given, of which full proof shall presently be
made. In the mean time it appears, that the act was
not on <em>this</em> account fundamentally wrong and unjust.</p>

<p>The <em>fourth</em> particular is, "That the <em>governor's consent</em>
and approbation be made necessary to every issue and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
application of the money, to be raised by virtue of such
act." The assembly intended this, and thought they
had done it in the act. The words of the clause being,
"That [the commissioners named] or the major part of
them, or of the survivors of them, <em>with the consent</em> or
approbation of the governor or commander in chief of
this province for the time being, shall order and appoint
<em>the disposition of the monies</em> arising by virtue of this act,
for and towards paying and clothing two thousand seven
hundred effective men," &amp;c. It was understood here,
that as the power of disposing was expressly to be with
the consent and approbation of the governor, the commissioners
had no power to dispose of the money without
that approbation: but their lordships, jealous (as
their station requires) of this prerogative of the crown,
and being better acquainted with the force and weakness
of law expression, did not think the clause explicit
enough, unless the words, "<em>and not otherwise</em>," were added,
or some other words equivalent. This particular,
therefore, was no more than another requisition of
greater <em>clearness</em> and precision; and by no means a foundation
for the charge of fundamentally wrong and
unjust.</p>

<p>The <em>fifth</em> particular was, "That <em>provincial</em> commissioners
be named, to hear and <em>determine appeals</em>, brought
on the part of the inhabitants, as well as the proprietaries."
There was already subsisting a provision for the
appointment of <em>county</em> commissioners of appeal; by
whom the act might be, and actually has been (as we
shall presently show) justly and impartially executed
with regard to the proprietaries; but <em>provincial</em> commissioners
appointed in the act it was thought might be of
use, in regulating and equalizing the modes of assessment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of different counties, where they were unequal;
and by affording a second appeal, tend more to the satisfaction
both of the proprietaries and the people.&mdash;This
particular was therefore a mere proposed improvement
of the act, which could not be, and was not,
in this respect, denominated fundamentally wrong and
unjust.</p>

<p>We have now gone through five of the six proposed
amendments, without discovering any thing on which
that censure could be founded; but the <em>sixth</em> remains;
which points at a part of the act wherein we must candidly
acknowledge there is something, that, in their
lordships' view of it, must justify their judgment. The
words of the <em>sixth</em> article are, "That the payments by
the tenants to the proprietaries of their rents, shall be
according to the terms of their respective grants, as if
such act had never been passed." This relates to that
clause of the act by which the <em>paper-money</em> was made a
<em>legal tender</em> in "discharge of all manner of debts, rents,
sum and sums of money whatsoever, &amp;c. at the rates
ascertained in the act of parliament made in the
sixth of Queen Anne." From the great injustice frequently
done to creditors, and complained of from the
colonies, by the vast depreciation of paper bills, it was
become a general fixed principle with the ministry, that
such bills (whose value, though fixed in the act, could
not be kept fixed by the act) ought <em>not</em> to be made a
legal tender in any colony at those rates. The parliament
had before passed an act, to take that tender away
in the four New England colonies, and have since made
the act general. This was what their lordships would
therefore have proposed for the amendment. But it
being represented, That the chief support of the credit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of the bills was the legal tender; and that without it
they would become of no value, it was allowed generally
to remain; with an exception to the proprietaries'
rents, where<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> there was a special contract for payment
in another coin. It cannot be denied but that <em>this</em> was
doing justice to the proprietaries; and that, had the requisition
been in favour of <em>all other</em> creditors also, the
justice had been equal, as being general. We do not
therefore presume to impeach their lordships' judgment,
that the act, as it enforced the acceptance of bills for
money at a value which they had only nominally, and
not really, was in that respect fundamentally wrong and
unjust. And yet we believe the reader will not think
the assembly so much to blame, when he considers, that
the making paper-bills a legal tender had been the universal
mode in America for more than threescore
years; that there was scarce a colony that had not
practised that mode more or less; that it had always
been thought absolutely necessary, in order to give the
bills a credit, and thereby obtain from them the uses
of money; that the inconveniences were therefore submitted
to, for the sake of the greater conveniences;
that acts innumerable of the like kind had been approved
by the crown; and that if the assembly made
the bills a legal tender at those rates to the proprietaries,
they made them also a legal tender to themselves
and all their constituents, many of whom might suffer
in their rents, &amp;c. as much in proportion to their estates
as the proprietaries. But if he cannot, on these considerations,
quite excuse the assembly, what will he think
of those honourable proprietaries, who, when paper-money
was issued in their colony, for the common defence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of their vast estates, with those of the people,
and who must therefore reap at least equal advantages
from those bills with the people, could nevertheless
wish to be exempted from their share of the unavoidable
disadvantages. Is there upon earth a man besides,
with any conception of what is honest, with any notion
of honour, with the least tincture in his veins of the
gentleman, but would have blushed at the thought; but
would have rejected with disdain such undue preference,
if it had been offered him? Much less would he
have struggled for it, moved heaven and earth to obtain
it, resolved to ruin thousands of his tenants by a
repeal of the act, rather than miss of it<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>; and enforce
it afterwards by an audaciously wicked instruction; forbidding
aids to his king, and exposing the province to
destruction, unless it was complied with. And yet,&mdash;These
are <em>honourable</em> men<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.</p>

<p>Here then we have a full view of the assembly's injustice;
about which there has been so much insolent
triumph! But let the proprietaries and their discreet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
deputies hereafter recollect and remember, that the same
august tribunal, which censured some of the modes and
circumstances of that act, did at the same time establish
and confirm the grand principle of the act, viz. "That
the proprietary estate ought, with other estates, to be
taxed:" and thereby did in effect determine and pronounce,
that the opposition so long made in various
shapes to that just principle, by the proprietaries, was
fundamentally <em>wrong</em> and <em>unjust</em>. An injustice they
were not, like the assembly, under any necessity of
committing for the public good, or any other necessity
but what was imposed on them by those base passions,
that act the tyrant in bad minds; their selfishness, their
pride, and their avarice.</p>

<p>I have frequently mentioned the <em>equitable intentions</em>
of the house in those parts of the act, that were supposed
obscure, and how they were understood here. A clear
proof thereof is found, as I have already said, in the
actual execution of the act; in the execution of it before
the contest about it in England; and therefore before
their lordships' objections to it had a being. When
the report came over, and was laid before the house,
one year's tax had been levied: and the assembly, conscious
that no injustice had been intended to the proprietaries,
and willing to rectify it if any should appear,
appointed a <em>committee</em> of members from the several
counties to examine into the state of the proprietaries'
taxes through the province, and nominated on that
committee a gentleman of known attachment to the
proprietaries, and their chief justice, Mr. Allen; to the
end that the strictest inquiry might be made. <em>Their
report</em> was as follows: "We, the committee appointed
to inquire into, and consider the state of the proprietary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
taxation through the several counties, and report the
same to the house, have, in pursuance of the said appointment,
carefully examined the returns of property,
and compared them with the respective assessments
thereon made through the whole province; and
find, <em>first</em>, That no part of the <em>unsurveyed</em> waste lands
belonging to the proprietaries have, in any instance,
been included in the estates taxed. <em>Secondly</em>, That some
of the <em>located uncultivated</em> lands belonging to the proprietaries
in several counties <em>remain unassessed</em>; and are not
in any county assessed higher, than the lands under like
circumstances belonging to the inhabitants. <em>Thirdly</em>,
That all <em>lands</em>; <em>not</em> granted by the proprietaries, <em>within
boroughs</em> and towns, remain <em>untaxed</em>; excepting in a
few instances, and in those they are rated as <em>low</em>, as the
lands which are granted in the said boroughs and towns.
The whole of the proprietary tax of eighteen pence in
the pound amounts to 566<em>l.</em> 4<em>s.</em> 10<em>d.</em> And the sum of
the tax on the inhabitants for the same year amounts,
through the several counties, to 27,103<em>l.</em> 12<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> And
it is the opinion of your committee, that there has not
been any injustice done to the proprietaries, or attempts
made to rate or assess any part of their estates higher
than the estates of the like kind belonging to the inhabitants
are rated and assessed; but, on the contrary,
we find that their estates are rated, in many instances,
below others.</p>

<p>The house communicated this report to governor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Hamilton, when he afterwards pressed them to make
the stipulated act of amendment; acquainting him at
the same time, that as in the execution of the act no injustice
<em>had</em> hitherto been done to the proprietary, so,
by a yearly inspection of the assessments, they would
take care that none <em>should</em> be done him; for that if any
should appear, or the governor could at any time point
out to them any that had been done, they would immediately
rectify it; and therefore, as the act was shortly
to expire, they did not think the amendments necessary.
Thus that matter ended during that administration.</p>

<p>And had his successor, governor Penn, permitted it
still to sleep, we are of opinion it had been more to the
honour of the family, and of his own discretion. But
he was pleased to found upon it a <em>claim</em> manifestly unjust,
and which he was totally destitute of reason to support.
A claim, that the proprietaries best and most
valuable located uncultivated lands, should be taxed no
<em>higher</em> than the worst and least valuable of those belonging
to the inhabitants: to enforce which, as he
thought the words of one of the stipulations seemed to
give some countenance to it, he insisted on using those
very words as sacred; from which he could "neither
in decency or in duty," deviate; though he had agreed
to deviate from words [in] the same report, and therefore
equally sacred in every other instance. A conduct
which will (as the prefacer says in governor Denny's
case) for ever disgrace the annals of <em>his</em> administration<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>.
Never did any administration open with a more <em>promising</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
prospect [than this of governor Penn]. He assured
the people, in his first speeches, of the proprietaries' paternal
regard for them, and their sincere disposition to do
every thing that might promote their happiness. As the
proprietaries had been pleased to appoint a son of the
family to the government, it was thought not unlikely,
that there might be something in these professions;
for that they would probably choose to have his administration
made easy and agreeable; and to that end
might think it prudent to withdraw those harsh, disagreeable,
and unjust instructions with which most of his
predecessors had been hampered: the assembly therefore
believed fully, and rejoiced sincerely. They showed
the new governor every mark of respect and regard that
was in their power. They readily and cheerfully went
into every thing he recommended to them. And when
he and his authority were insulted and endangered by
a lawless murdering mob, they and their friends took
arms at his call, and formed themselves round him for
his defence, and the support of his government. But
when it was found, that those mischievous instructions
still subsisted, and were even farther extended; when
the governor began, unprovoked, to send the house
affronting messages, seizing every imaginary occasion
of reflecting on their conduct; when every other symptom
appeared of fixed deep-rooted family malice, which
could but a little while bear the unnatural covering that
had been thrown over it, what wonder is it, if all the
old wounds broke out and bled afresh? if all the old
grievances, still unredressed, were recollected; if despair
succeeded of [seeing] any peace with a family, that
could make such returns to all their overtures of kindness!
And when in the very proprietary council, composed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of staunch friends of the family, and chosen for
their attachment to it, it was observed, that the <em>old men</em>
(1 Kings, chap. xii.) withdrew themselves, finding their
opinion slighted, and that all measures were taken by
the advice of two or three <em>young men</em> (one of whom too
denies his share in them) is it any wonder, since like
causes produce like effects, if the assembly, notwithstanding
all their veneration for the first proprietor,
should say, with the children of Israel, under the same
circumstances, "What portion have we in David, or
inheritance in the son of Jesse? To your tents, O Israel!"</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, and a conviction that
while so many natural sources of difference subsisted
between proprietaries and people, no harmony in government
long subsist (without which neither the commands
of the crown could be executed, nor the public
good promoted) the house resumed the consideration of
a measure that had often been proposed in former assemblies;
a measure, that every <em>proprietary province in</em>
America had, from the same causes, found themselves
obliged to take, and had actually taken, or were about
to take; and a measure, that had happily succeeded,
wherever it was taken; I mean the recourse to an immediate
<em>royal government</em>.</p>

<p>They therefore, after a thorough debate, and making
no less than twenty-five unanimous resolves, expressing
the many grievances this province had long laboured
under, through the proprietary government, came to
the following resolution, viz. "Resolved, nemine contradicente,
That this house will adjourn, in order to
<em>consult their constituents</em>, whether an humble <em>address</em>
should be drawn up and transmitted to <em>his Majesty</em>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
praying that he would be graciously pleased to take the
people of this province under his immediate protection
and government, by completing the agreement heretofore
made with the first proprietary for the sale of the
government to the crown, or otherwise as to his wisdom
and goodness shall seem meet<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>."</p>

<p>This they ordered to be made public; and it was published
accordingly in all the newspapers: the house
then adjourned for no less than <em>seven weeks</em>, to give
their constituents time to consider the matter, and
themselves an opportunity of taking their opinion and
advice. Could any thing be more deliberate, more fair
and open, or more respectful to the people that chose
them?&mdash;During this recess, the people, in many places,
held little meetings with each other; the result of
which was, that they would manifest their sentiments
to their representatives, by petitioning the crown directly
of themselves, and requesting the assembly to
transmit and support those petitions. At the next
meeting many of these petitions were delivered to the
house with that request; they were signed by a very
great<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> number of the most substantial inhabitants; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>not the least intimation was received by the assembly
from any other of their constituents, that the method
was <em>disapproved</em>; except in a petition from an obscure
town-ship in Lancaster county, to which there were
about forty names indeed, but all evidently signed by
three hands only. What could the assembly infer from
the expressed willingness of a part, and silence of the
rest; but that the measure was universally agreeable!
They accordingly resumed the consideration of it; and
though a small, very small opposition then appeared to
it in the house; yet as even that was founded not on
the impropriety of the thing; but on supposed unsuitableness
of the time or the manner, and a majority
of nine tenths being still for it; a petition was drawn
agreeable to the former resolve, and ordered to be
transmitted to his majesty.</p>

<p>But the preface tells us, that these <em>petitioners</em> for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
change were a "number of rash, ignorant, and inconsiderate
people," and generally of a <em>low rank</em>. To be
sure they were not of the proprietary officers, dependents,
or expectants; and those are chiefly the people
of high rank among us; but they were otherwise generally
men of the best estates in the province, and men
of reputation. The assembly, who come from all parts
of the country, and therefore may be supposed to know
them, at least as well as the prefacer, have given that
testimony of them. But what is the testimony of the
assembly; who in his opinion are equally rash, ignorant,
and inconsiderate with the petitioners? And if his
judgment is right, how imprudently and contrary to
their charter, have his <em>three hundred thousand souls</em> acted
in their elections of assembly-men these twenty years
past; for the charter requires them to choose men of
<em>most note</em> for <em>virtue</em>, <em>wisdom</em> and <em>ability</em>!</p>

<p>But these are qualities engrossed, it seems, by the
<em>proprietary</em> party. For they say, "the <em>wiser</em> and <em>better</em>
part of the province had far different notions of this
measure: they considered, that the moment they put
their hands to these petitions they might be surrendering
up their birthright." I felicitate them on the <em>honour</em>
they have thus bestowed upon themselves; on the
<em>sincere</em> compliments thus given and accepted; and on
their having with such noble freedom discarded the
snivelling pretence to modesty, couched in that threadbare
form of words, "though we say it, that should not
say it." But is it not surprising, that, during the seven
weeks recess of the assembly, expressly to consult their
constituents on the expediency of this measure, and
during the fourteen days the house sat deliberating on
it after they met again, these their wisdoms and betternesses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
should never be so kind as to communicate the
least scrap of their prudence, their knowledge, or their
consideration, to their rash, ignorant, and inconsiderate
representatives? Wisdom in the mind is not like money
in the purse, diminished by communication to others:
they might have lighted up our farthing candles for us,
without lessening the blaze of their own flambeaux.
But they suffered our representatives to go on in the
dark till the fatal deed was done; and the petition sent
to the king, praying him to take the government of
this province into his immediate care: whereby, if it
succeeds, "our glorious plan of public liberty and
charter of privileges is to be bartered away," and we
are to be made slaves for ever! Cruel parsimony! to
refuse the charity of a little understanding, when God
had given you so much, and the assembly begged it as
an alms! O that you had but for once remembered and
observed the counsel of that wise poet Pope, where
he says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Be niggards of advice on no pretence;</p>
<p class="verse">For the worst avarice is that of sense.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the constitution of our government, and in that of
one more, there still remains a particular thing that
none of the other American governments have; to wit,
the appointment of a governor by the <em>proprietors</em>, instead
of an appointment by the <em>crown</em>. This particular in
government has been found inconvenient; attended
with contentions and confusions wherever it existed;
and has therefore been gradually taken away from colony
after colony, and every where greatly to the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'satisfacton'">satisfaction</ins>
and happiness of the people. Our wise first
proprietor and founder was fully sensible of this; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
being desirous of leaving his people happy, and preventing
the mischiefs that he foresaw must in time arise
from that circumstance if it was continued, he determined
to take it away, if possible, during his own lifetime.
They accordingly entered into a contract for the
sale of the proprietary right of government to the
crown, and actually received a sum in part of the consideration.
As he found himself likely to die before
that contract (and with it, his plan for the happiness of
his people) could be completed, he carefully made it a
part of his last will and testament; devising the right
of the government to two noble lords, in trust, that they
should release it to the crown. Unfortunately for us,
this has never yet been done. And this is merely what
the assembly now desire to have done. Surely he that
formed our constitution, must have understood it. If
he had imagined, that all our privileges depended on
the proprietary government; will any one suppose, that
he would himself have meditated the change; that he
would have taken such effectual measures, as he thought
them, to bring it about speedily, whether he should live
or die? Will any of those, who now extol him so highly,
charge him at the same time with the baseness of endeavouring
thus to defraud his people of all the liberties
and privileges he had promised them, and by the
most solemn charters and grants assured to them, when
he engaged them to assist him in the settlement of his
province? Surely none can be so inconsistent!&mdash;And
yet this proprietary right of governing or appointing a
governor has all of a sudden changed its nature; and
the preservation of it become of so much importance to
the welfare of the province, that the assembly's only
petitioning to have their venerable founder's will executed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and the contract he entered into for the good of
his people completed, is stiled, an "attempt to violate
the constitution for which our fathers planted a wilderness;
to barter away our glorious plan of public liberty
and charter privileges; a risquing of the whole constitution;
an offering up of our whole charter rights; a
wanton sporting with things sacred, &amp;c."</p>

<p>Pleasant surely it is to hear the proprietary partizans,
of all men, bawling for the constitution, and affecting
a terrible concern for our liberties and privileges.
They, who have been these twenty years cursing our
constitution, declaring that it was no constitution, or
worse than none; and that things could never be well
with us till it was new modelled, and made exactly
conformable to the British constitution: they, who have
treated our distinguishing privileges as so many illegalities
and absurdities; who have solemnly declared in
print, that though such privileges might be proper in
the infancy of a colony to encourage its settlement, they
became unfit for it in its grown state, and ought to be
taken away: they, who by numberless falshoods, propagated
with infinite industry in the mother country,
attempted to procure an act of parliament for the actual
depriving a very great part of the people of their privileges:
they too, who have already deprived the whole
people of some of their most important rights, and are
daily endeavouring to deprive them of the rest: are
these become patriots and advocates for our constitution?
Wonderful change! astonishing conversion!
Will the wolves then protect the sheep, if they can but
persuade them to give up their dogs? Yes; the assembly
would destroy all their own rights, and those of the
people; and the proprietary partizans are become the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
champions for liberty! Let those who have faith now
make use of it: for if it is rightly defined, the evidence
of things not seen, certainly never was there more occasion
for such evidence, the case being totally destitute
of all other.</p>

<p>It has been long observed, that men are with that
party, angels or demons, just as they happen to concur
with or oppose their measures. And I mention it for
the comfort of <em>old sinners</em>, that in politics, as well as
in religion, repentance and amendment, though late,
shall obtain forgiveness, and procure favour. Witness
the late speaker, Mr. Norris; a steady and constant opposer
of all the proprietary encroachments; and whom,
for thirty years past, they have been therefore continually
abusing, allowing him no one virtue or good
quality whatsoever: but now, as he shewed some unwillingness
to engage in this present application to the
crown, he is become all at once the "faithful servant;"&mdash;but
let me look at the text, to avoid mistakes&mdash;and
indeed I was mistaken&mdash;I thought it had been "faithful
servant of the public," but I find it is only "of the
house." Well chosen that expression, and prudently
guarded. The former, from a proprietary pen, would
have been praise too much, only for disapproving the
<em>time</em> of the application. Could <em>you</em>, much respected
[Mr. Norris], go but a little farther, and disapprove the
application itself? Could you but say, the proprietary
government is a good one, and ought to be continued;
then might all your political offences be done away, and
your scarlet sins become as snow and wool; then might
you end your course with (proprietary) honour. P&mdash;&mdash; should
preach your funeral sermon, and S&mdash;&mdash;, the poisoner
of other characters, embalm your memory. But those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
honours you will never receive; for with returning
health and strength you will be found in your old post,
firm for your country.</p>

<p>There is encouragement too for <em>young sinners</em>. Mr.
Dickenson, whose speech our prefacer has introduced
to the world, (though long hated by some, and disregarded
by the rest of the proprietary faction) is at once,
for the same reason as in Mr. Norris's case, become a
sage in the law, and an oracle in matters relating to
our constitution. I shall not endeavour to pluck so
much as a leaf from these the young gentleman's laurels.
I would only advise him carefully to preserve the panegyrics
with which they have adorned him: in time they
may serve to console him, by balancing the calumny
they shall load him with, when he does not go through
with them in all their measures: he will not probably do
the one, and they will then assuredly do the other.
There are mouths that can blow hot as well as cold, and
blast on your brows the bays their hands have placed
there. "Experto crede Roberto." Let but the moon
of <em>proprietary</em> favour withdraw its shine for a moment,
and that "great number of the <em>principal gentlemen</em> of
Philadelphia," who applied to you for the copy of your
speech, shall immediately despise and desert you.</p>

<p>"Those principal gentlemen!" What a pity it is
that their names were not given us in the preface, together
with their admirable letter! We should then have
known, where to run for advice on all occasions. We
should have known, who to choose for our future representatives:
for undoubtedly these were they that are
elsewhere called "the <em>wiser</em> and <em>better</em> part of the province."
None but their wisdoms could have known
before-hand, that a speech which they never heard, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
a copy of which they had never seen, but were then
requesting to see, was "a spirited defence," and "of
our charter privileges," and that "the publication of it
would be of great utility, and give general satisfaction."
No inferior sagacity could discover, that the appointment
of a governor by the proprietor was one of our
"charter privileges," and that those who opposed the
application for a royal government were therefore patriot
members, appearing on the side of our privileges
and our charter!</p>

<p>Utterly to <em>confound the assembly</em>, and show the excellence
of proprietary government, the prefacer has
extracted from their own votes, the <em>praises</em> they have
from time to time bestowed on the <em>first</em> proprietor, in
their addresses to his sons. And though addresses are
not generally the best repositories of historical truth,
we must not in this instance deny their authority.</p>

<p class="center">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>What then avails it to the honour of the present proprietors,
that our founder and their father gave us privileges,
if they, the sons, will not permit the use of
them, or forcibly rend them from us? David may have
been a man after God's own heart, and Solomon the
wisest of proprietors and governors; but if Rehoboam
will be a tyrant and a &mdash;&mdash;, who can secure him the
affections of the people? The virtue and merit of his
ancestors may be very great, but his presumption in
depending upon those alone may be much greater.</p>

<p>I lamented, a few pages ago, that we were not acquainted
with the names of those "principal gentlemen,
the wiser and better part of the province." I now rejoice
that we are likely, some time or other, to know
them; for a copy of a <em>petition to the king</em> is now before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
me; which, from its similarity with their <em>letter</em>, must be
of their inditing, and will probably be recommended to
the people, by their leading up the signing.</p>

<p>On this petition I shall take the liberty of making a
few <em>remarks</em>, as they will save me the necessity of following
farther the preface; the sentiments of this and
that being nearly the same.</p>

<p>It begins with a formal quotation from the [assembly's]
petition, which they own they have not seen, and
of words that are not in it; and after relating very imperfectly
and unfairly the fact relating to their application
for a copy of it, which is of no importance, proceeds
to set forth, "that as we and all your American
subjects must be governed by persons authorised and
approved by your Majesty, on the best recommendation
that can be obtained of them; we cannot perceive
our condition in this respect to be <em>different</em> from our
fellow-subjects around us, or that we are thereby less
under your majesty's particular care and protection
than they are; since there can be no <em>governors</em> of this
province without your majesty's <em>immediate approbation</em>
and authority." Such a declaration from the wiser
part of the province is really a little surprising. What!
when disputes concerning matters of property are daily
arising between you and your proprietaries, cannot
your wisdoms perceive the least difference between having
the judges of those disputes appointed by a <em>royal</em>
governor, who has no interest in the cause, and having
them appointed by the <em>proprietaries</em> themselves, the
principal parties against you; and <em>during their pleasure</em>
too? When supplies are necessary to be raised for your
defence, can you perceive no difference between having
a royal governor, free to promote his majesty's service
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
by a ready assent to your laws; and a proprietary governor,
shackled by instructions, forbidding him to give
that assent, unless some private advantage is obtained,
some profit got, or unequal exemption gained for their
estate, or some privilege wrested from you? When prerogative,
that in other governments is only used for the
good of the people, is here strained to the extreme, and
used to their prejudice, and the proprietaries benefit,
can you perceive no difference? When the direct and
immediate rays of majesty benignly and mildly shine
on all <em>around</em> us, but are transmitted and thrown upon
<em>us</em> through the burning-glass of proprietary government,
can your sensibilities feel no difference? Sheltered
perhaps in proprietary offices, or benumbed with
expectations, it may be you cannot. But surely you
might have known better than to tell his majesty, "that
there can be no governors of this province, without his
immediate approbation." Don't you know, who know
so much, that by our blessed constitution the <em>proprietors</em>
themselves, whenever they please, may govern us in
<em>person</em>, without such approbation?</p>

<p>The petition proceeds to tell his majesty, "that the
particular mode of government which we enjoy, under
your majesty, is held in the <em>highest estimation</em> by good
men of all denominations among us; and hath <em>brought
multitudes</em> of industrious people from various parts of
the world," &amp;c. Really! Can this be from proprietary
partizans? That constitution, which they were for ever
censuring as defective in a legislative council, defective
in government powers, too popular in many of its
modes, is it now become so excellent? Perhaps, as
they have been tinkering it these twenty years, till they
have stripped it of some of its most valuable privileges,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and almost spoiled it, they now begin to like it. But
then it is not surely this <em>present</em> constitution, that
brought hither those multitudes. They came before.
At least it was not that particular in our constitution
(the proprietary power of appointing a governor) which
attracted them, that single particular, which alone is
now in question, which our venerable founder first, and
now the assembly, are endeavouring to change. As to the
remaining valuable part of our constitution, the assembly
have been equally full and strong in expressing their
regard for it, and perhaps stronger and fuller; for <em>their</em>
petition, in that respect, is in the nature of a petition of
right: it lays claim, though modestly and humbly, to
those privileges on the foundation of royal grants, on
laws confirmed by the crown, and on justice and equity,
as the grants were the consideration offered to induce
them to settle, and which they have in a manner purchased
and paid for, by executing that settlement without
putting the crown to any expence. Whoever
would know what our constitution was, when it was so
much admired, let him peruse that elegant <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'farewel-speech'">farewell speech</ins>
of Mr. Hamilton, father of our late governor,
when, as speaker, he took his leave of the house, and
of public business, in 1739; and then let him compare
that constitution with the present. The power of <em>appointing
public officers</em> by the representatives of the people,
which he so much extols, where is it now? Even
the bare naming to the governor in a bill, a trivial officer
to receive a light-house duty (which could be considered
as no more than a mere recommendation) is, in
a late message, styled, "an encroachment on the prerogative
of the crown!" The sole power of <em>raising and
disposing of public money</em>, which he says was then lodged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
in the assembly, that inestimable privilege, what is become
of it? Inch by inch they have been wrested from
us in times of public distress; and the rest are going
the same way. I remember to have seen, when governor
Hamilton was engaged in a dispute with the assembly
on some of those points, a copy of that speech,
which then was intended to be reprinted, with a dedication
to that honourable gentleman, and this motto
from John Rogers's verses in the Primer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">We send you here a little book,</p>
<p class="verse4">For you to look upon;</p>
<p class="verse">That you may see your father's face,</p>
<p class="verse4">Now he is dead and gone.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Many a such little book has been sent by our assemblies
to the present proprietaries: but they do not like to
see their father's face; it puts their own out of countenance.</p>

<p>The petition proceeds to say, "that such disagreements
as have arisen in this province, we have beheld
with sorrow; but as others around us are not exempted
from the <em>like misfortunes</em>, we can by no means conceive
them incident to the nature of our government, which
hath <em>often</em> been administered with remarkable harmony:
and your majesty, before whom our late disputes have
been laid, can be at no loss, in your great wisdom, to discover,
whether they proceed from the above cause, or
should be ascribed to some others." The disagreements
in question are proprietary disagreements in government,
relating to proprietary private interests. And
are not the <em>royal</em> governments around us exempt from
<em>these</em> misfortunes? Can you really, gentlemen, by no
means conceive, that proprietary government disagreements
are incident to the nature of proprietary governments?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
If your wisdoms are so hard to conceive, I am
afraid they will never bring forth. But then our government
"hath <em>often</em> been administered with remarkable
harmony." Very true; as often as the assembly
have been able and willing to purchase that harmony,
and pay for it, the mode of which has already been
shown. And yet that word <em>often</em> seems a little unluckily
chosen: the flame that is often put out, must be as
often lit. If our government hath often been administered
with remarkable harmony, it hath as often been
administered with remarkable discord: one often is as
numerous as the other. And his majesty, if he should
take the trouble of looking over our disputes (to which
the petitioners, to save themselves a little pains,
modestly and decently refer him) where will he, for
twenty years past, find any but <em>proprietary</em> disputes concerning
proprietary interests; or disputes that have
been connected with and arose from them?</p>

<p>The petition proceeds to assure his majesty, "that
this province (except from the Indian ravages) enjoys
the <em>most perfect internal tranquillity</em>!"&mdash;Amazing! what!
the most perfect tranquillity! when there have been
three atrocious riots within a few months! when in two
of them, horrid murders were committed on twenty
innocent persons; and in the third, no less than one
hundred and forty like murders were meditated, and
declared to be intended, with as many more as should
be occasioned by any opposition! when we know that
these rioters and murderers have none of them been
punished, have never been prosecuted, have not even
been apprehended! when we are frequently told, that
they intend still to execute their purposes, as soon as
the protection of the king's forces is withdrawn! Is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
our tranquillity more perfect now, than it was between
the first riot and the second, or between the second
and the third? And why "except the Indian ravages,"
is a <em>little intermission</em> to be denominated "the most
perfect tranquillity?" For the Indians too have been
quiet lately. Almost as well might ships in an engagement
talk of the most perfect tranquillity between two
broadsides. But "a spirit of riot and violence is foreign
to the general temper of the inhabitants." I
hope and believe it is; the assembly have said nothing
to the contrary. And yet is there not too much of it?
Are there not pamphlets continually written, and daily
sold in our streets, to justify and encourage it? Are not
the mad armed mob in those writings instigated to embrue
their hands in the blood of their fellow-citizens,
by first applauding their murder of the Indians, and
then representing the assembly and their friends as
worse than Indians, as having privately stirred up the
Indians to murder the white people, and armed and
rewarded them for that purpose? <span class="smcap">Lies</span>, gentlemen, villanous
as ever the malice of hell invented, and which,
to do you justice, not one of you believes, though you
would have the mob believe them.</p>

<p>But your petition proceeds to say, "that where such
disturbances have happened, they have been <em>speedily
quieted</em>." By whom were they quieted? The <em>two first</em>,
if they can be said to be quieted, were quieted only by
the rioters themselves going home quietly (that is,
without any interruption) and remaining there till
their next insurrection, without any pursuit, or attempt
to apprehend any of them. And the <em>third</em>, was it
quieted, or was the mischief they intended prevented,
or could it have been prevented, without the aid of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
king's troops, marched into the province for that purpose?&mdash;"The
civil powers have been supported," in
some sort. We all know how they were supported;
but have they been <em>fully</em> supported? Has the government
sufficient strength, even with all its supports, to
venture on the apprehending and punishment of those
notorious offenders? If it has not, why are you angry
at those who would strengthen its hands by a more
immediate royal authority? If it has, why is not the
thing done? Why will the government, by its conduct,
strengthen the suspicions (groundless no doubt) that it
has come to a private understanding with those murderers,
and that impunity for their past crimes is to be the
reward of their future political services?&mdash;O! but says
the petition, "there are perhaps cases in all governments
where it may <em>not be possible speedily to discover
offenders</em>." Probably; but is there any case in any
government where it is not possible to <em>endeavour</em> such a
discovery? There may be cases where it is not safe to
do it: and perhaps the best thing our government can
say for itself is, that that is our case. The only objection
to such an apology must be, that it would justify
that part of the assembly's petition to the crown, which
relates to the <em>weakness</em> of our present government.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Still, if there is any <em>fault</em>, it must be <em>in the assembly</em>;
for, says the petition, "if the executive part of our
government should seem in any case too weak, we conceive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
it is the duty of the assembly, and in <em>their</em> power,
to strengthen it." This weakness, however, you have
just denied. "Disturbances you say <em>have</em> been speedily
quieted, and the civil power supported," and
thereby you have deprived your insinuated charge
against the assembly of its only support. But is it not a
fact known to you all, that the assembly <em>did</em> endeavour
to strengthen the hands of the government? That, at
his honour's instance, they prepared and passed in a few
hours a bill for extending hither the act of parliament
for dispersing rioters? That they also passed and presented
to him a militia bill, which he refused, unless
powers were thereby given him over the lives and properties
of the inhabitants, which the public good did
not require; and which their duty to their constituents
would not permit them to trust in the hands of any
proprietary governor? You know the points, gentlemen:
they have been made public. Would you have
had your representatives give up those points? Do <em>you</em>
intend to give them up, when at the next election <em>you</em>
are made assemblymen? If so, tell it us honestly beforehand,
that we may know what we are to expect when
we are about to choose you?</p>

<p>I come now to the last clause of your petition, where,
with the same wonderful sagacity with which you in
another case discovered the excellency of a speech you
never heard, you undertake to <em>characterise a petition</em>
[<em>from the</em> assembly] <em>you own you never saw</em>; and venture
to assure his majesty, that it is "exceeding grievous in
its nature, that it by no means contains a proper representation
of the state of this province, and is repugnant
to the general sense of his numerous and loyal subjects
in it." Are then his majesty's "numerous and loyal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
subjects" in this province all as great wizards as yourselves,
and capable of knowing, without seeing it, that
a petition is repugnant to their general sense? But the
inconsistence of your petition, gentlemen, is not so
much to be wondered at; the <em>prayer</em> of it is <em>still more</em>
extraordinary, "We therefore most humbly pray, that
your majesty would be graciously pleased <em>wholly to disregard</em>
the said petition of the assembly." What! without
enquiry! without examination! without a hearing
of what the assembly might say in support of it!
"wholly disregard" the petition of your representatives
in assembly, accompanied by other petitions, signed by
thousands of your fellow-subjects as loyal, if not as
wise and as good, as yourselves! Would you wish to see
your great and amiable prince act a part that could not
become a dey of Algiers? Do you, who are Americans,
pray for a <em>precedent</em> of such contempt in the treatment
of an American assembly! such "total disregard" of
their humble applications to the throne? Surely your
wisdoms here have overshot yourselves.&mdash;But as wisdom
shows itself not only in doing what is right, but in confessing
and <em>amending</em> what is wrong, I recommend the
latter particularly to your present attention; being
persuaded of this consequence, that though you have
been mad enough to sign such a petition, you never
will be fools enough to present it.</p>

<p>There is one thing mentioned in the preface, which
I find I omitted to take notice of as I came along, <em>the
refusal of the house to enter Mr. Dickinson's protest</em> on
their minutes. This is mentioned in such a manner there
and in the newspapers, as to insinuate a charge of some
partiality and injustice in the assembly. But the <em>reasons</em>
were merely these, that though protesting may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
a practice with the lords of parliament, there is no instance
of it in the house of commons, whose proceedings
are the model followed by the assemblies of America;
that there is no precedent of it on our votes, from
the beginning of our present constitution; and that the
introducing such a practice would be attended with inconveniences,
as the representatives in assembly are
not, like the lords in parliament, unaccountable to any
constituents, and would therefore find it necessary for
their own justification, if the reasons of the minority for
being against a measure were admitted in the votes, to
put there likewise the reasons that induced the majority
to be for it: whereby the votes, which were intended
only as a register of propositions and determinations,
would be filled with the disputes of members with
members, and the public business be thereby greatly
retarded, if ever brought to a period.</p>

<p>As that protest was a mere abstract of Mr. Dickinson's
speech, every particular of it will be found answered
in the following speech of Mr. Galloway, from
which it is fit that I should no longer detain the
reader.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

these provincial politics, I shall confine myself to some imperfect anecdotes
concerning the parties, &amp;c. A speech, which Mr. Dickinson had delivered
in the Pensylvania assembly against the abolition of the proprietary government,
having been published, and a preface having been written to it,
as I think by a Dr. Smith, Mr. Galloway's speech was held forth as a proper
answer to that speech, while the preface to it appeared balanced by
the above preface from Dr. Franklin. Mr. Galloway's speech, or probably
the advertisement that attended it, urged, I believe, Mr. Dickinson
first to a challenge, and then to a printed reply.&mdash;The controversy was
quickly republished in England, or at least the principal parts of it; and
it is from the English edition of Mr. Galloway's speech (printed in London
by Nichols in 1765) that I have copied the above.
</p>
<p>
These several gentlemen however seem, for a time, to have better agreed
in their subsequent opinions concerning American taxation by Great Britain;
Mr. Dickinson, in particular, having taken a very spirited line in
the Farmer's Letters and other pieces, which procured him considerable
reputation. The congress declaration, nevertheless, for independence, was
reported not to have given perfect satisfaction at first, either to himself or
to Mr. Galloway. And in the event, Mr. Galloway thought proper to
come over to General Howe, and afterwards to embark for England.

and refused to sign it. The truth is, that his number of souls is vastly exaggerated.
The dwelling-houses in the province in 1752 did not exceed
20,000. Political arithmeticians reckon generally but five souls to a
house, one house with another; and therefore, allowing for houses since
built, there are not probably more than an hundred and ten thousand souls
in the province; that of these, scarce twenty two thousand could with any
propriety be petitioners. And considering the scattered settlement of
the province; the general inattention of mankind, especially in new countries,
to public affairs; and the indefatigable pains taken by the proprietaries'
new allies the presbyterian clergy of Philadelphia, (who wrote circular
letters to every congregation in the county, to deter them from
petitioning, by dutiful intimations, that if we were reduced to a royal
government, it would be the "ruin of the province;") it is a wonder the
number (near a sixth part) was so great as it was. But if there had been
no such petitions, it would not have been material to the point. The <em>assembly</em>
went upon another foundation. They had adjourned to consult

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Remarks on a late Protest against the Appointment of Mr.
Franklin as Agent for this Province</em> [of Pensylvania].</a></h3>

<p>I have generally passed over, with a silent disregard,
the <em>nameless</em> abusive pieces that have been written
against me; and though this paper, called a <em>protest</em>, is
signed by some respectable names, I was, nevertheless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
inclined to treat it with the same indifference; but, as
the assembly is therein reflected on upon my account,
it is thought more my duty to make some remarks
upon it.</p>

<p>I would first observe then, that this mode of <em>protesting</em>
by the minority, with a string of reasons against the
proceedings of the majority of the house of assembly,
is quite new among us; the present is the second we
have had of the kind, and both within a few months.
It is unknown to the practice of the house of commons,
or of any house of representatives in America, that I
have heard of; and seems an affected imitation of the
lords in parliament, which can by no means become
assemblymen of America. Hence appears the absurdity
of the complaint, that the house refused the protest
an <em>entry</em> on their minutes. The protesters know, that
they are not, by any custom or usage, intitled to such
an entry; and that the practice here is not only useless
in itself, but would be highly inconvenient to the house,
since it would probably be thought necessary for the
majority also to enter their reasons, to justify themselves
to their constituents; whereby the minutes would
be incumbered and the public business obstructed.
More especially will it be found inconvenient, if such
protests are made use of as a new form of libelling, as
the vehicles of personal malice, and as means of giving
to private abuse the appearance of a <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'sauction'">sanction</ins> as public
acts. Your protest, gentlemen, was therefore properly
refused; and since it is no part of the proceedings of
assembly, one may with the more freedom examine it.</p>

<p>Your first reason against my appointment is, that you
"believe me to be the chief author of the measures
pursued by the last assembly, which have occasioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
<em>such uneasiness</em> and distraction among the good people
of this province." I shall not dispute my share in those
measures; I hope they are such as will in time do
honour to all that were concerned in them. But you
seem mistaken in the order of time: it was the uneasiness
and distraction among the good people of the province
that occasioned the measures; the province was
in confusion before they were taken, and they were pursued
in order to prevent such uneasiness and distraction
for the future. Make one step farther back, and you
will find proprietary injustice supported by proprietary
minions and creatures, the original cause of all our uneasiness
and distractions.</p>

<p>Another of your reasons is, "that I am, as you are
informed, very <em>unfavourably</em> thought of by several of
his <em>majesty's ministers</em>." I apprehend, gentlemen, that
your informer is mistaken. He indeed has taken great
pains to give unfavourable impressions of me, and perhaps
may flatter himself, that it is impossible so much
true industry should be totally without effect. His
long success in maiming or murdering all the reputations
that stand in his way (which has been the dear delight
and constant employment of his life) may likewise
have given him some just ground for confidence, that
he has, as they call it, <em>done for me</em>, among the rest. But,
as I said before, I believe he is mistaken. For what
have I done, that they should think unfavourably of
me? It cannot be my constantly and uniformly promoting
the measures of the crown, ever since I had
any influence in the province. It cannot, surely, be
my promoting the change from a proprietary to a royal
government. If indeed I had, by speeches and writings,
endeavoured to make his majesty's government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
universally odious in the province: if I had harangued
by the week to all comers and goers, on the pretended
injustice and oppressions of royal government, and the
slavery of the people under it: if I had written traitorous
papers to this purpose, and got them translated into
other languages, to give his majesty's foreign subjects
here those horrible ideas of it: if I had declared, written,
and printed, that "the king's little finger we should
find heavier than the proprietor's whole loins," with regard
to our liberties; <em>then indeed</em> might the ministers
be supposed to think unfavourably of me. But these
are not exploits for a man, who holds a profitable office
under the crown, and can expect to hold it no longer
than he behaves with the fidelity and duty that becomes
every good subject. They are only for officers of proprietary
appointment, who hold their commissions during
his, and not the king's pleasure; and who, by dividing
among themselves and their relations, offices of
many thousands a year enjoyed by proprietary favour,
<em>feel</em> where to place their loyalty. I wish they were as
good subjects to his majesty; and perhaps they may
be so, when the proprietary interferes no longer.</p>

<p>Another of your reasons is, "that the proposal of me
for <em>an agent</em> is extremely disagreeable to a very great
number of the most serious and reputable inhabitants
of the province; and the <em>proof</em> is, my having been rejected
at the last election, though I had represented the
city in assembly for fourteen years."</p>

<p>And do those of you, gentlemen, reproach me with
this, who, among near four thousand voters, had
scarcely a score more than I had? It seems then, that
your <em>elections</em> were very near being <em>rejections</em>, and
thereby furnishing the same proof in your case that you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
produce in mine, of <em>your</em> being likewise extremely disagreeable
to a very great number of the most serious
and reputable people. Do you, honourable sir, reproach
me with this, who, for almost twice fourteen years
have been rejected (if <em>not being chosen</em> is <em>to be rejected</em>)
by the same people? and (unable, with all your wealth
and connections, and the influence they give you, to
obtain an election in the county where you reside, and
the city where you were born, and are best known)
have been obliged to accept a seat from one of the out-counties,
the remotest of the province!&mdash;It is known,
sir, to the persons who proposed me, that I was first
chosen against my inclination, and against my entreaties
that I might be suffered to remain a private man.
In none of the fourteen elections you mention, did I
ever appear as a candidate. I never did, directly or
indirectly, solicit any man's vote. For six of the years
in which I was annually chosen, I was absent, residing
in England; during all which time, your secret and
open attacks upon my character and reputation were
incessant; and yet you gained no ground. And can you
really, gentlemen, find matter of triumph in this <em>rejection</em>
as you call it? A moment's reflection on the means
by which it was obtained must make you ashamed
of it.</p>

<p>Not only my duty to the crown, in carrying the post-office
act more duly into execution, was made use of to
exasperate the ignorant, as if I was encreasing my own
profits, by picking their pockets; but my very zeal in
opposing the murderers, and supporting the authority
of government; and even my humanity, with regard to
the innocent Indians under our protection, were mustered
among my offences, to stir up against me those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
religious bigots, who are of all savages the most brutish.
Add to this, the numberless falshoods propagated as
truths, and the many perjuries procured among the
wretched rabble, brought to swear themselves intitled to
a vote: And yet so <em>poor a superiority</em> obtained at all this
expence of honour and conscience! can this, gentlemen,
be matter of triumph? Enjoy it then. Your exultation,
however, was short. Your artifices did not prevail
every where; nor your double tickets and whole
boxes of forged votes. A great majority of the new-chosen
assembly were of the old members, and remain
uncorrupted. They still stood firm for the people, and
will obtain justice from the proprietaries. But what
does that avail to you, who are in the proprietary interest?
And what comfort can it afford you, when, by
the assembly's choice of an agent, it appears that the
same, to you obnoxious, man (notwithstanding all your
venomous invectives against him) still retains so great a
share of the public confidence?</p>

<p>But "this step, you say, gives you the more lively
affliction, as it is taken at the <em>very moment</em> when you
were informed by a member of the house, that the governor
had assured him of his having received instructions
from the proprietaries, to give his assent to the
taxation of their estates; in the <em>same manner</em> that the
estates of other persons are to be taxed; and also <em>to
confirm</em>, for the public use, the several squares formerly
<em>claimed</em> by the city." O the force of friendship! the
power of interest! What politeness they infuse into a
writer, and what <em>delicate</em> expressions they produce!&mdash;The
dispute between the proprietaries and us was about
the <em>quantum</em>, the <em>rate</em> of their taxation, and not about
the <em>manner</em>; but now, when all the world condemns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
them for requiring a partial exemption of their estates,
and they are forced to submit to an honest equality,
it is called "<em>assenting</em> to be taxed in the <em>same manner</em>
with the people." Their <em>restitution</em> of five public
squares in the plan of the city, which they had near
forty years unjustly and dishonourably seized and detained
from us, (directing their surveyor to map streets
over them, in order to turn them into lots, and their
officers to sell a part of them;) this their <em>disgorging</em> is
softly called <em>confirming</em> them for the public use; and
instead of the plain words "<em>formerly given</em> to the city,
by the first proprietary, their father," we have the cautious
pretty expression of "formerly <em>claimed</em> by the
city:" Yes; not only <em>formerly</em>, but <em>always</em> claimed, ever
since they were <em>promised</em> and <em>given</em> to encourage the
settlers; and ever will be <em>claimed</em>, till we are put in
actual possession of them. It is pleasant, however, to
see how lightly and tenderly you trip over these matters,
as if you trod upon eggs. But that "<em>very moment</em>,"
that precious moment! Why was it so long delayed?
Why were those healing instructions so long
withheld and concealed from the people? They were,
it seems, brought over by Mr. Allen:<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> intelligence
was received by various hands from London, that orders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
were sent by the proprietaries, from which great hopes
were entertained of an accommodation. Why was the
bringing and the delivery of such orders so long <em>denied</em>?
The reason is easily understood. Messieurs Barclays,
friends to both proprietaries and people, wished for that
gentleman's happy arrival; hoping his <em>influence</em>, added
to the <em>power</em> and <em>commissions</em> the proprietaries had vested
him with, might prove effectual in restoring harmony
and tranquillity among us; but <em>he</em>, it seems, hoped his
<em>influence</em> might do the business, without those additions.
There appeared on his arrival some prospect (from sundry
circumstances) of a <em>change</em> to be made in the house
by the approaching election. The proprietary friends
and creatures knew the heart of their master; and how
extremely disagreeable to him that <em>equal taxation</em>, that
<em>restitution</em>, and the other <em>concessions</em> to be made for the
sake of a reconciliation, must necessarily be. They
hoped therefore to spare him all those mortifications,
and thereby secure a greater portion of his favour.
Hence the instructions were not produced to the last
assembly, though they arrived before the September
sitting, when the governor was in town, and actually
did business with the house. Nor to the new assembly
were they mentioned, till the "<em>very moment</em>," the fatal
moment, when the house were on the point of choosing
that wicked adversary of the proprietary to be an <em>agent</em>
for the province in England.</p>

<p>But I have, you say, a "fixed <em>enmity to the proprietaries</em>,"
and "you believe it will <em>preclude all accommodation</em>
of our disputes with them, even on just and reasonable
terms." And why do you think I have a fixed
enmity to the proprietaries? I have never had any personal
difference with them. I am no land-jobber; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
therefore have never had any thing to do with their
land-office or officers; if I had, probably, like others,
I might have been obliged to truckle to their measures,
or have had like causes of complaint. But our private
interests never clashed; and all their resentment against
me, and mine to them, has been on the public account.
Let them do justice to the people of Pensylvania, act
honourably by the citizens of Philadelphia, and become
honest men; my enmity, if that's of any consequence,
ceases from the "<em>very moment</em>;" and, as soon as I possibly
can, I promise to love, honour and respect them.
In the mean time, why do you "believe it will preclude
all <em>accommodation</em> with them on just and reasonable
terms?" Do you not boast, that their gracious condescensions
are in the hands of the governor; and that
"if this had been the usual time for business, his honour
would have sent them down in a message to the house."
How then can my going to England prevent this accommodation?
The governor can call the house when
he pleases; and, one would think, that, at least in your
opinion, my being out of the way would be a favourable
circumstance. For then, by "cultivating the disposition
shown by the proprietaries, every <em>reasonable demand</em>
that can be made on the part of the people might be
obtained: in vigorously insisting on which, you promise
to unite most earnestly with the rest of the house." It
seems then we have "<em>reasonable demands</em>" to make,
and, as you call them a little higher, <em>equitable demands</em>.
This is much for proprietary minions to own; but you
are all growing better, in imitation of your master,
which is indeed very commendable. And if the accommodation
here should fail, I hope, that though you dislike
the person a majority of two to one in the house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
have thought fit to appoint an agent, you will nevertheless,
in duty to your country, continue the noble resolution
of uniting with the rest of the house, in vigorously
insisting on that <em>equity</em> and <em>justice</em>, which such an
union will undoubtedly obtain for us.</p>

<p>I pass over the trivial charge against the assembly,
that they "acted with <em>unnecessary haste</em> in proceeding
to this appointment, without making a small adjournment,"
&amp;c. and your affected apprehensions of danger
from that haste. The necessity of expedition on this
occasion is as obvious to every one out of doors, as it
was to those within; and the fears you mention are
not, I fancy, considerable enough to break your rest.
I come then to your <em>high</em> charge against me, "that I
heretofore ventured, <em>contrary</em> to an act of assembly, to
place the public money in the stocks; whereby this
province suffered a loss of 6000<em>l.</em> and that sum, added
to the 5000<em>l.</em> granted for my expences, makes the whole
cost of my former voyage to England amount to <em>eleven
thousand pounds</em>!" How wisely was that form in our
laws contrived, which, when a man is arraigned for his
life, requires the evidence to speak <em>the truth</em>, the <em>whole
truth</em>, and <em>nothing but the truth</em>! The reason is manifest.
A falshood may destroy the innocent, so may <em>part of a
truth</em> without <em>the whole</em>; and a mixture of truth and
falshood may be full as pernicious. You, Mr. Chief
Justice, and the other justices among the protesters,
and you, sir, who are a counsellor at law, must all of
you be well acquainted with this excellent form; and
when you arraigned my reputation (dearer to me than
life) before the assembly, and now at the respectable
tribunal of the public, would it not have well become
your honours to have had some small regard at least to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the spirit of that form? You might have mentioned,
that the direction of the act, to lodge the money in the
bank, subject to the drafts of the trustees of the loan-office
here, was impracticable; that the bank refused to
receive it on those terms, it being contrary to their settled
rules to take charge of money subject to the orders
of unknown people living in distant countries. You
might have mentioned, that the house being informed
of this, and having no immediate call for the money,
did <em>themselves</em> adopt the measure of placing it in the
stocks, which then were low, where it might on a peace
produce a considerable profit, and in the mean time
accumulate an interest: that they even passed a bill,
directing the subsequent sums granted by parliament to
be placed with the former: that the measure was prudent
and safe; and that the loss arose, not from <em>placing</em>
the money <em>in</em> the stocks, but from the imprudent and
unnecessary <em>drawing it out</em> at the very time when they
were lowest, on some slight uncertain rumours of a
peace concluded: that if the assembly had let it remain
another year, instead of losing they would have gained
<em>six thousand pounds</em>; and that after all, since the exchange
at which they sold their bills was near <em>twenty per
cent</em> higher when they drew than when the stocks were
purchased, the loss was far from being so great as you
represent it. All these things you might have said; for
they are, and you know them to be, part of the <em>whole
truth</em>; but they would have spoiled your accusation.
The late speaker of your honourable house, Mr. Norris,
(who has, I suppose, all my letters to him, and copies of
his own to me, relating to that transaction) can testify
with how much integrity and clearness I managed the
whole affair. All the house were sensible of it, being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
from time to time fully acquainted with the facts. If I
had gone to gaming in the stocks with the public money,
and through my fault a sum was lost, as your protest
would insinuate, why was I not censured and punished
for it when I returned? You, honourable sir, (my
enemy of seven years standing) was then in the house.
You were appointed on the committee for examining
my accounts; you reported, that you found them just,
and signed that report.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> I never solicited the employ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
of agent; I made no bargain for my future service,
when I was ordered to England by the assembly; nor
did they vote me any salary. I lived there near six
years at my own expence, and I made no charge or demand
when I came home. You, sir, of all others, was
the very member that proposed (for the honour and
justice of the house) a compensation to be made me of
the <em>five thousand pounds</em> you mention. Was it with an
intent to reproach me thus publicly for accepting it? I
thanked the house for it then, and I thank you now for
proposing it: though you, who have lived in England,
can easily conceive, that besides the prejudice to my
private affairs by my absence, a <em>thousand pounds</em> more
would not have reimbursed me. The money voted was
immediately paid me. But if I had occasioned the loss
of <em>six thousand pounds</em> to the province, here was a fair
opportunity of securing easily the greatest part of it;
why was not the <em>five thousand pounds</em> deducted, and the
remainder called for? The reason is, this accusation was
not then invented. Permit me to add, that supposing
the whole <em>eleven thousand pounds</em> an expence occasioned
by my voyage to England, yet the taxation of the proprietary
estate now established will, when valued by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
years purchase, be found in time an advantage to the
public, far exceeding that expence. And if the expence
is at present a burthen, the odium of it ought to
lie on those, who, by their injustice, made the voyage
necessary; and not on me, who only submitted to the
orders of the house in undertaking it.</p>

<p>I am now to take leave (perhaps a last leave) of the
country I love, and in which I have spent the greatest
part of my life.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Esto Perpetua.</span>&mdash;I wish every kind
of prosperity to my friends,&mdash;and I forgive my enemies.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Remarks on a Plan for the future Management of Indian Affairs.</em></a><a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></h3>

<p>The regulations in this plan seem to me to be in general
very good: but some few appear to want explanation,
or farther consideration.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>
<p><em>Clause</em> 3. Is it intended by this clause, to prevent the
trade that Indians, living near the frontiers, may choose
to carry on with the inhabitants, by bringing their skins
into the [English] settlements? This prevention is
hardly practicable; as such trade may be carried on in
many places out of the observation of government; the
frontier being of great extent, and the inhabitants
thinly settled in the woods, remote from each other.
The Indians too do not every where live in towns sufficiently
numerous to encourage traders to reside among
them, but in scattered families, here and there, often
shifting their situation for the sake of better hunting;
and if they <em>are</em> near the English settlements, it would
seem to them very hard to be obliged to carry their
skins for sale to remote towns or posts, when they
could dispose of them to their neighbours, with less
trouble, and to greater advantage; as the goods they
want for them, are and must be dearer at such remote
posts.</p>

<p>4. The colony "laws for regulating Indian affairs or
commerce" are the result of long experience, made by
people on the spot, interested to make them good; and
it would be well to consider the matter thoroughly, before
they are repealed, to make way for new untried
schemes.</p>

<p>By whom are they to be repealed? By the colony
assemblies, or by parliament? Some difficulty will arise
here.</p>

<p>13. The districts seem too large for this. The Indians
under the care of the northern superintendant, by
this plan, border on the colonies of Nova Scotia, Quebec,
New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut,
New York, New Jersey, Pensylvania, Maryland, Virginia:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the superintendant's situation, remote from many
of these, may occasion great inconvenience, if his consent
is always to be necessary in such cases.</p>

<p>14. This seems too much to be done, when the vastness
of the district is considered. If there were more
districts and smaller, it might be more practicable.</p>

<p>15 and 16. Are these agents or commissaries to try
causes where life is concerned? Would it not be better,
to send the criminals into some civil well settled government
or colony for trial, where good juries can be
had?</p>

<p>18. "<em>Chief for the whole tribe; who shall constantly
reside with the commissary, &amp;c.</em>" Provision must then be
made for his maintenance, as particular Indians have
no estates, but live by hunting, and their public has
no funds or revenues. Being used to rambling, it
would perhaps not be easy to find one, who would be
obliged to this constant residence; but it may be tried.</p>

<p>22. If the agent and his deputies, and the commissaries,
are not to trade, should it not be a part of their
oath, that they will have no concern in such trade, directly
or indirectly? Private agreements between them
and the traders, for share of profits, should be guarded
against, and the same care taken to prevent, if possible,
private agreements between them and the purchasers of
Indian lands.</p>

<p>31. &mdash;&mdash; "or trading at any other post, &amp;c." This
should be so expressed, as to make the master liable
for the offence of the servant; otherwise it will have no
effect.</p>

<p>33. I doubt the settling of <em>tariffs</em> will be a matter of
difficulty. There may be differences of fineness, goodness,
and value, in the goods of different traders, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
cannot be properly allowed for by general tariffs. And it
seems contrary to the nature of commerce, for government
to interfere in the prices of commodities. Trade
is a voluntary thing between buyer and seller; in every
article of which, each exercises his own judgment, and
is to please himself. Suppose either Indian or trader
is dissatisfied with the tariff, and refuses barter on those
terms, are the refusers to be compelled? if not, why
should an Indian be forbidden to take more goods for
skins than your tariff allows, if the trader is willing to
give them, or a trader more skins for his goods, if the
Indian is willing to give them? Where there are a
number of different traders, the separate desire of each
to get more custom will operate in bringing down their
goods to a reasonable price. It therefore seems to me,
that trade will best find and make its own rates; and
that government cannot well interfere, unless it will
take the whole trade into its own hands (as in some colonies
it does) and manage it by its own servants, at its
own risque.</p>

<p>38. I apprehend, that if the Indians cannot get <em>rum</em>
of fair traders, it will be a great means of defeating all
these regulations, that direct the trade to be carried on
at certain posts. The countries and forests are so very
large, it is scarce possible to guard every part, so as to
prevent unlicensed traders drawing the Indians and the
trade to themselves, by rum and other spiritous liquors,
which all savage people are so fond of. I think they
will generally trade where they can get rum, preferably
to where it is refused them; and the proposed prohibition
will therefore be a great encouragement to unlicensed
traders, and promote such trade. If the commissaries,
or officers at the posts, can prevent the selling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of rum during the barter for other goods, and until
the Indians are about going away, it is perhaps all that
is practicable or necessary. The missionaries will,
among other things, endeavour to prevail with them to
live soberly and avoid drunkenness.</p>

<p>39. The Indian trade, so far as <em>credit</em> is concerned,
has hitherto been carried on wholly upon honour.
They have among themselves no such things as prisons
or confinements for debt. This article seems to imply,
that an Indian may be compelled by law to pay a debt
of fifty shillings or under. Our legal method of compulsion
is by imprisonment: the Indians cannot and
will not imprison one another; and if we attempt to
imprison them, I apprehend it would be generally disliked
by the nations, and occasion breaches. They
have such high ideas of the value of personal liberty,
and such slight ones of the value of personal property;<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
that they would think the disproportion monstrous between
the liberty of a man, and a debt of a few shillings;
and that it would be excessively inequitable and unjust,
to take away the one for a default in payment of the
other. It seems to me therefore best, to leave that
matter on its present footing; the debts <em>under</em> fifty shillings
as irrecoverable by law, as this article proposes for
the debts <em>above</em> fifty shillings. Debts of honour are generally
as well paid as other debts. Where no compulsion
can be used, it is more disgraceful to be dishonest.
If the trader thinks his risque greater in trusting
any particular Indian, he will either not do it, or proportion
his price to his risque.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>
<p>44. As the goods for the Indian trade all come from
England, and the peltry is chiefly brought to England;
perhaps it will be best to lay the duty here, on the exportation
of the one, and the importation of the other,
to avoid meddling with the question, of the right to lay
duties in America by parliament here.</p>

<p>If it is thought proper to carry the trading part of
this plan into execution, would it not be well to <em>try it
first in a few posts</em>, to which the present colony laws for
regulating the Indian trade do not reach; that by experience
its utility may be ascertained, or its defects
discovered and amended, before it is made general, and
those laws repealed to make way for it?&mdash;If the Indians
find by experience, that they are better used in their
trade at the posts, under these regulations, than at other
places, may it not make them desirous of having the
regulations extended to other places; and when extended,
better satisfied with them upon reflection and
comparison<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>?</p>

before the close of the year 1766, and (as I am inclined to think) after
the commencement of 1765. I can go no nearer as to its date.
</p>
<p>
It is needless to enter into the particulars of it, as the remarks explain
themselves; except perhaps as to the following points. The trade was to
be open; there were to be two superintendants to it; in the northern
district the trade was to be carried on at fixed posts, in the southern within
the Indian town; the military were to have no power over the superintendants
or the Indian trade, even in war time, unless with the superintendants'
assent, or in great exigencies; the superintendants, by themselves
or deputies, were to make annual visitations among the Indians, to see to
justice, &amp;c. and their proceedings were to be very summary; and no credit
was to be given to the Indians beyond fifty shillings, for no higher debt
was to be made recoverable. B.&nbsp;V.</p></div>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>As the cause of the present ill humour in America,
and of the resolutions taken there to purchase less of
our manufactures, does not seem to be generally understood,
it may afford some satisfaction to your readers,
if you give them the following short historical state of
facts.</p>

<p>From the time that the colonies were first considered
as capable of <em>granting aids to the crown</em>, down to the
end of the last war, it is said, that the constant mode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
of obtaining those aids was, by requisition made from
the crown, through its governors, to the several assemblies,
in circular letters from the secretary of state, in
his majesty's name, setting forth the occasion, requiring
them to take the matter into consideration, and expressing
a reliance on their prudence, duty, and affection
to his majesty's government, that they would grant such
sums, or raise such numbers of men, as were suitable to
their respective circumstances.</p>

<p>The colonies, being accustomed to this method, have
from time to time granted money to the crown, or
raised troops for its service, in proportion to their abilities,
and, during all the last war, beyond their abilities;
so that considerable sums were returned them
yearly by parliament, as they had exceeded their proportion.</p>

<p>Had this happy method of requisition been continued
(a method that left the king's subjects in those remote
countries the pleasure of showing their zeal and
loyalty, and of imagining that they recommended themselves
to their sovereign by the liberality of their voluntary
grants) there is no doubt, but all the money
that could reasonably be expected to be raised from
them in any manner, might have been obtained, without
the least heart-burning, offence, or breach of the
harmony of affections and interests, that so long subsisted
between the two countries.</p>

<p>It has been thought wisdom in a government exercising
sovereignty over different kinds of people, to have
<em>some regard to prevailing and established opinions</em> among
the people to be governed, wherever such opinions
might in their effects obstruct or promote public measures.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
If they tend to obstruct public service, they are
to be changed, if possible, before we attempt to act
against them; and they can only be changed by reason
and persuasion. But if public business can be carried
on without thwarting those opinions, if they can be, on
the contrary, made subservient to it; they are not unnecessarily
to be thwarted, how absurd such popular
opinions may be in their nature.</p>

<p>This had been the wisdom of our government with
respect to raising money in the colonies. It was well
known, that the colonists universally were of opinion,
that no money could be levied from English subjects
but by their own consent, given by themselves or their
chosen representatives; that therefore whatever money
was to be raised from the people in the colonies must
first be granted by their assemblies, as the money raised
in Britain is first to be granted by the house of commons;
that this right of granting their own money was essential
to English liberty; and that if any man, or body of men
in which they had no representative of their choosing,
could tax them at pleasure, they could not be said to
have any property, any thing they could call their own.
But as these opinions did not hinder their granting money
voluntarily and amply, whenever the crown, by its
servants, came into their assemblies (as it does into its
parliaments of Britain or Ireland) and demanded aids;
therefore that method was chosen, rather than the hateful
one of arbitrary taxes.</p>

<p>I do not undertake here to support these opinions of
the Americans; they have been refuted by a late act of
parliament, declaring its own power; which very parliament,
however, showed wisely so much tender regard
to those inveterate prejudices, as to repeal a tax that
had militated against them. And those prejudices are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
still so fixed and rooted in the Americans, that it has
been supposed, not a single man among them has been
convinced of his error, even by that act of parliament.</p>

<p>The person then, who first projected to lay aside the
accustomed method of requisition, and to raise money
on America by <em>stamps</em>, seems not to have acted wisely,
in deviating from that method (which the colonists
looked upon as constitutional) and thwarting unnecessarily
the fixed prejudices of so great a number of the
king's subjects. It was not, however, for want of knowledge,
that what he was about to do would give them
offence; he appears to have been very sensible of this,
and apprehensive that it might occasion some disorders;
to prevent or suppress which, he projected another
bill, that was brought in the same session with the
stamp act, whereby it was to be made lawful for military
officers in the colonies to quarter their soldiers in
private houses. This seemed intended to awe the people
into a compliance with the other act. Great opposition
however being raised here against the bill by the
agents from the colonies and the merchants trading
thither (the colonists declaring, that under such a power
in the army, no one could look on his house as his own,
or think he had a home, when soldiers might be thrust
into it and mixed with his family at the pleasure of an
officer) that part of the bill was dropped; but there still
remained a clause, when it passed into a law, to oblige
the several assemblies to provide quarters for the soldiers,
furnishing them with firing, bedding, candles,
small beer or rum, and sundry other articles, at the expence
of the several provinces. And this act continued
in force when the stamp act was repealed; though, if
obligatory on the assemblies, it equally militated against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the American principle above mentioned, that money
is not to be raised on English subjects without their
consent.</p>

<p>The colonies, nevertheless, being put into high good
humour by the repeal of the stamp act, chose to avoid
a fresh dispute upon the other, it being temporary and
soon to expire, never, as they hoped, to revive again;
and in the mean time they, by various ways, in different
colonies, provided for the quartering of the troops,
either by acts of their own assemblies, without taking
notice of the act of parliament, or by some variety or
small diminution, as of salt and vinegar, in the supplies
required by the act; that what they did might appear
a voluntary act of their own, and not done in due obedience
to an act of parliament, which, according to
their ideas of their rights, they thought hard to obey.</p>

<p>It might have been well if the matter had then passed
without notice; but a governor having written home
an angry and aggravating letter upon this conduct in
the assembly of his province, the outed [proposer<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>] of
the stamp act and his adherents (then in the opposition)
raised such a clamour against America, as being in rebellion,
and against those who had been for the repeal
of the stamp act, as having thereby been encouragers of
this supposed rebellion; that it was thought necessary to
enforce the quartering act by another act of parliament,
taking away from the province of New York (which
had been the most explicit in its refusal) all the powers
of legislation, till it should have complied with that act.
The news of which greatly alarmed the people every
where in America, as the language of such an act
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
seemed to them to be&mdash;obey implicitly laws made by
the parliament of Great Britain to raise money on you
without your consent, or you shall enjoy no rights or
privileges at all.</p>

<p>At the same time a person lately in high office<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> projected
the levying more money from America, by new
duties on various articles of our own manufacture (as
glass, paper, painters' colours, &amp;c.) appointing a new
board of customs, and sending over a set of commissioners,
with large salaries, to be established at Boston,
who were to have the care of collecting those duties,
which were by the act expressly mentioned to be intended
for the payment of the salaries of governors,
judges, and other officers of the crown in America; it
being a pretty general opinion here, that those officers
ought not to depend on the people there, for any part
of their support.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to combat this opinion. But
perhaps it may be some satisfaction to your readers, to
know what ideas the Americans have on the subject.
They say then, as to governors, that they are not like
princes whose posterity have an inheritance in the government
of a nation, and therefore an interest in its
prosperity; they are generally strangers to the provinces
they are sent to govern; have no estate, natural
connection, or relation there, to give them an affection
for the country; that they come only to make money
as fast as they can; are sometimes men of vicious characters
and broken fortunes, sent by a minister merely
to get them out of the way; that as they intend staying
in the country no longer than their government continues,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
and purpose to leave no family behind them,
they are apt to be regardless of the good-will of the people,
and care not what is said or thought of them after
they are gone. Their situation at the same time gives
them many opportunities of being vexatious; and they
are often so, notwithstanding their dependence on the
assemblies for all that part of their support, that does
not arise from fees established by law, but would probably
be much more so, if they were to be supported
by money drawn from the people without their consent
or good-will, which is the professed design of this new
act. That if by means of these forced duties, government
is to be supported in America, without the intervention
of the assemblies, their assemblies will soon be
looked upon as useless; and a governor will not call
them, as having nothing to hope from their meeting,
and perhaps something to fear from their inquiries into,
and remonstrances against, his mal-administration.
That thus the people will be deprived of their most essential
right. That it being (as at present) a governor's
interest to cultivate the good-will, by promoting the
welfare of the people he governs, can be attended with
no prejudice to the mother-country, since all the laws
he may be prevailed on to give his assent to are subject
to revision here, and if reported against by the board
of trade, are immediately repealed by the crown; nor
dare he pass any law contrary to his instructions; as he
holds his office during the pleasure of the crown, and
his securities are liable for the penalties of their bonds,
if he contravenes those instructions. This is what they
say as to governors.</p>

<p>As to <em>judges</em>, they alledge, that being appointed from
hence, and holding their commissions not during good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
behaviour, as in Britain, but during pleasure: all the
weight of interest or influence would be thrown into
one of the scales (which ought to be held even) if the
salaries are also to be paid out of duties raised upon the
people without their consent, and independent of their
assemblies approbation or disapprobation of the judges
behaviour. That it is true, judges should be free from
all influence; and therefore, whenever government
here will grant commissions to able and honest judges
during good behaviour, the assemblies will settle permanent
and ample salaries on them during their commissions;
but at present, they have no other means of
getting rid of an ignorant or an unjust judge (and some
of scandalous characters have, they say, been sometimes
sent them) left, but by starving them out.</p>

<p>I do not suppose these reasonings of theirs will appear
here to have much weight. I do not produce
them with an expectation of convincing your readers.
I relate them merely in pursuance of the task I have
imposed on myself, to be an impartial historian of
American facts and opinions. &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p>The colonists being thus greatly alarmed, as I said
before, by the news of the act for abolishing the legislature
of New York, and the imposition of these new
duties, professedly for such disagreeable purposes (accompanied
by a new set of revenue officers, with large
appointments, which gave strong suspicions, that more
business of the same kind was soon to be provided for
them, that they might earn their salaries) began seriously
to consider their situation; and to revolve afresh
in their minds, grievances, which, from their respect and
love for this country, they had long borne and seemed
almost willing to forget. They reflected how lightly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the interest of <em>all</em> America had been estimated here,
when the interests of a <em>few</em> of the inhabitants of Great
Britain happened to have the smallest competition
with it. That the whole American people was forbidden
the advantage of a direct importation of wine, oil,
and fruit, from Portugal; but must take them loaded
with all the expence of a voyage one thousand leagues
round about, being to be landed first in England, to be
re-shipped for America; expences amounting, in war-time,
at least to thirty pounds per cent more than otherwise
they would have been charged with; and all this
merely, that a few Portugal merchants in London may
gain a commission on those goods passing through
their hands. (Portugal merchants, by the bye, that can
complain loudly of the smallest hardships laid on their
trade by foreigners, and yet even in the last year could
oppose with all their influence the giving ease to their
fellow-subjects labouring under so heavy an oppression!)
That on a slight complaint of a few Virginia
merchants, nine colonies had been restrained from
making paper-money, become absolutely necessary to
their internal commerce, from the constant remittance
of their gold and silver to Britain.&mdash;But not only the
interest of a particular body of <em>merchants</em>, but the interest
of any small body of British <em>tradesmen or artificers</em>
has been found, they say, to outweigh that of all the
king's subjects in the colonies. There cannot be a
stronger natural right than that of a man's making the
best profit he can of the natural produce of his lands,
provided he does not thereby hurt the state in general.
Iron is to be found every where in America, and beaver
are the natural produce of that country: hats, and
nails and steel are wanted there as well as here. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
of no importance to the common welfare of the empire,
whether a subject of the king gets his living by making
hats on this, or on that side of the water. Yet the hatters
of England have prevailed to obtain an act in their
own favour, restraining that manufacture in America;
in order to oblige the Americans to send their beaver
to England to be manufactured, and purchase back the
hats, loaded with the charges of a double transportation.
In the same manner have a few nail-makers, and still a
smaller body of steel-makers (perhaps there are not half
a dozen of these in England) prevailed totally to forbid
by an act of parliament the erecting of slitting-mills, or
steel furnaces in America; that the Americans may be
obliged to take all their nails for their buildings, and
steel for their tools, from these artificers, under the
same disadvantages.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>
<p>Added to these, the Americans remembered the act
authorizing the most <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'cruel idsult'">cruel insult</ins> that perhaps was ever
offered by one people to another, that of <em>emptying our
gaols</em> into their settlements; Scotland too having within
these two years obtained the privilege it had not before,
of sending its rogues and villains also to the plantations&mdash;I
say, reflecting on these things, they said one
to another (their newspapers are full of such discourses)
"These people are not content with making a monopoly
of us (forbidding us to trade with any other country
of Europe, and compelling us to buy every thing of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
them, though in many articles we could furnish ourselves
ten, twenty, and even to fifty per cent cheaper
elsewhere;) but now they have as good as declared they
have a right to tax us <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</span>, internally and externally;
and that our constitutions and liberties shall all
be taken away, if we do not submit to that claim.</p>

<p>"They are not content with the high prices at which
they sell us their goods, but have now begun to enhance
those prices by new duties, and by the expensive
apparatus of a new set of officers, appear to intend
an augmentation and multiplication of those burthens,
that shall still be more grievous to us. Our people
have been foolishly fond of their superfluous modes
and manufactures, to the impoverishing our own country,
carrying off all our cash, and loading us with debt;
they will not suffer us to restrain the luxury of our inhabitants,
as they do that of their own, by laws: they can
make laws to discourage or prohibit the importation of
French superfluities: but though those of England are
as ruinous to us as the French ones are to them, if we
make a law of that kind, they immediately repeal it.
Thus they get all our money from us by trade; and
every profit we can any where make by our fisheries,
our produce, or our commerce, centres finally with
them;&mdash;but this does not satisfy.&mdash;It is time then to
take care of ourselves by the best means in our power.
Let us unite in solemn resolution and engagements with
and to each other, that we will give these new officers
as little trouble as possible, by not consuming the British
manufactures on which they are to levy the duties.
Let us agree to consume no more of their expensive
gewgaws. Let us live frugally, and let us industriously
manufacture what we can for ourselves: thus we shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
be able honourably to discharge the debts we already
owe them; and after that, we may be able to keep some
money in our country, not only for the uses of our internal
commerce, but for the service of our gracious
sovereign, whenever he shall have occasion for it, and
think proper to require it of us in the old constitutional
manner.&mdash;For notwithstanding the reproaches thrown
out against us in their public papers and pamphlets,
notwithstanding we have been reviled in their senate as
rebels and traitors, we are truly a loyal people. Scotland
has had its rebellions, and England its plots
against the present royal family; but <em>America is untainted
with those crimes</em>; there is in it scarce a man,
there is not a single native of our country, who is not
firmly attached to his King by principle and by affection.
But a new kind of loyalty seems to be required
of us, a loyalty to parliament; a loyalty, that is to extend,
it is said, to a surrender of all our properties,
whenever a house of commons, in which there is not a
single member of our chusing, shall think fit to grant
them away without our consent, and to a patient suffering
the loss of our privileges as Englishmen, if we
cannot submit to make such surrender. We were separated
too far from Britain by the ocean, but we were
united to it by respect and love; so that we could at
any time freely have spent our lives and little fortunes
in its cause: but this unhappy new system of politics
tends to dissolve those bands of union, and to sever us
for ever."</p>

<p>These are the wild ravings of the, at present, half-distracted
Americans. To be sure, no reasonable man
in England can approve of such sentiments, and, as I
said before, I do not pretend to support or justify
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
them: but I sincerely wish, for the sake of the manufactures
and commerce of Great Britain, and for the
sake of the strength, which a firm union with our growing
colonies would give us, that these people had never
been thus needlessly driven out of their senses.</p>

of the farmer's seventh letter (written by Mr. Dickenson.)
</p>
<p>
"Many remarkable instances might be produced of the extraordinary
inattention with which bills of great importance concerning these colonies
have passed in parliament; which is owing, as it is supposed, to the bills
being brought in, by the persons who have points to carry, so artfully framed,
that it is not easy for the members in general in the haste of business,
to discover their tendency.
</p>
<p>
"The following instances show the truth of this remark.
</p>
<p>
"When Mr. Grenville, in the violence of reformation and innovation,
formed the 4th George III. chap. 15th, for regulating the American trade,
the word 'Ireland' was dropt in the clause relating to our iron and lumber,
so that we could send these articles to no other part of Europe, but to Great
Britain. This was so unreasonable a restriction, and so contrary to the
sentiments of the legislature, for many years before, that it is surprising it
should not have been taken notice of in the house. However, the bill passed
into a law. But when the matter was explained, this restriction was
taken off in a subsequent act.
</p>
<p>
"I cannot say, how long after the taking off this restriction, as I have
not the acts, but I think in less than eighteen months, another act of parliament
passed, in which the word 'Ireland' was left out as it had been
before. The matter being a second time explained was a second time
regulated.
</p>
<p>
"Now if it be considered, that the omission mentioned, struck off, with
one word, so very great a part of our trade, it must appear remarkable:
and equally so is the method by which rice became an enumerated commodity,
and therefore could be carried to <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Great Britian'">Great Britain</ins> only.
</p>
<p>
"The enumeration was obtained, (says Mr. Gee on Trade, p. 32) by one
Cole, a captain of a ship, employed by a company then trading to Carolina;
for several ships going from England thither, and purchasing rice for
Portugal, prevented the aforesaid captain of a loading. Upon his coming
home he possessed one Mr. Lowndes, a member of parliament, (who was
frequently employed to prepare bills) with an opinion, that carrying rice
directly to Portugal was a prejudice to the trade of England, and privately
got a clause into an act to make it an enumerated commodity, by which
means he secured a freight to himself. But the consequence proved a vast
loss to the nation.
</p>
<p>
"I find that this clause, 'privately got into an act, for the benefit of
Captain Cole, to the vast loss of the nation,' is foisted into the 3d Anne,
chapter 5th, intitled, 'an act for granting to her majesty a further subsidy
on wines and merchandizes imported,' with which it has no more connection,
than with 34th Edward I. 34th and 35th of Henry VIII. or the 25th
Charles II. which provide that no person shall be taxed but by himself or
his representatives." B.&nbsp;V.</p></div>

</p>
<p>
In the <em>collection of tracts on the subjects of taxing the British colonies in
America, and regulating their trade</em> (printed in 1773, in 4 vols. 8vo. by
Almon) I find <em>two</em> papers, said there to have been published originally in
1739, and to have been drawn up by a club of American merchants, at the
head of whom were Sir William Keith (governor of Pensylvania), Joshua
Gee, and many other eminent persons. The <em>first</em> paper proposes the
raising a small body of regular <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'trroops'">troops</ins> under the command of an officer
appointed by the crown and independent of the governors (who were
nevertheless to assist him in council on emergent occasions) in order to
protect the Indian trade, and take care of the boundaries and back settlements.
They were to be supported by a revenue to be established by <em>act
of parliament</em>, in America; which revenue was to arise out of a duty on
<em>stampt paper and parchment</em>. The <em>second</em> paper goes into the particulars
of this proposed stamp duty, offers reasons for extending it over all the
British plantations, and recites its supposed advantages. If these papers
are at all genuine (a fact about which I am not in the least informed)
Mr. George Grenville does not appear to have been original in conceiving
<em>stamps</em> as a proper subject for his new tax. See ib. vol. I.  B.&nbsp;V.</p></div></div>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Jan. 6, 1766.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>I have attentively perused the paper you sent me,
and am of opinion, that the measure it proposes, of an
<em>union</em> with the colonies, is a wise one: but I doubt it
will hardly be thought so here, till it is too late to attempt
it. The time has been, when the colonies would
have esteemed it a great advantage, as well as honour
to them, to be permitted to send members to parliament;
and would have asked for that privilege, if they
could have had the least hopes of obtaining it. The
time is now come, when they are indifferent about it,
and will probably not ask it, though they might accept
it if offered them; and the time will come, when they
will certainly refuse it. But if such an union were now
established (which methinks it highly imports this
country to establish) it would probably subsist as long
as Britain shall continue a nation. This people, however,
is too proud, and too much despises the Americans,
to bear the thought of admitting them to such an
equitable participation in the government of the whole.
Then the <em>next best</em> thing seems to be, leaving them in
the quiet enjoyment of their respective constitutions;
and when money is wanted for any public service in
which they ought to bear a part, calling upon them by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
requisitorial letters from the crown (according to the
long established custom) to grant such aids as their
loyalty shall dictate, and their abilities permit. The
very sensible and benevolent author of that paper,
seems not to have known, that such a constitutional
custom subsists, and has always hitherto been practised
in America; or he would not have expressed himself in
this manner: "It is evident beyond a doubt, to the
intelligent and impartial, that after the very extraordinary
efforts, which were effectually made by Great Britain
in the late war to save the colonists from destruction,
and attended of necessity with an enormous load
of debts in consequence, that the same colonists, now
firmly secured from foreign enemies, should be somehow
induced to contribute some proportion towards the
exigencies of state in future." This looks as if he conceived
the war had been carried on at the sole expence
of Great Britain, and the colonies only reaped the benefit,
without hitherto sharing the burthen, and were
therefore now indebted to Britain on that account.
And this is the same kind of argument that is used by
those who would fix on the colonies the heavy charge
of unreasonableness and ingratitude, which I think your
friend did not intend. Please to acquaint him then,
that the fact is not so: that every year during the war,
requisitions were made by the crown on the colonies
for raising money and men; that accordingly they
made <em>more extraordinary</em> efforts, in proportion to their
abilities, than Britain did; that they raised, paid and
clothed, for five or six years, near 25,000 men, besides
providing for other services (as building forts, equipping
guard-ships, paying transports, &amp;c.) And that
this was more than their fair proportion is not merely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
an opinion of mine, but was the judgment of government
here, in full knowledge of all the facts; for the
then ministry, to make the burthen more equal, recommended
the case to parliament, and obtained a reimbursement
to the Americans of about 200,000<em>l.</em> sterling
every year; which amounted only to about two fifths
of their expence; and great part of the rest lies still a
load of debt upon them; heavy taxes on all their estates,
real and personal, being laid by acts of their assemblies
to discharge it, and yet will not discharge it in many
years. While then these burthens continue: while
Britain restrains the colonies in every branch of commerce
and manufactures that she thinks interferes with
her own; while she drains the colonies, by her trade
with them, of all the cash they can procure by every
art and industry in any part of the world, and thus keeps
them always in her debt: (for they can make no law to
discourage the importation of your to <em>them</em> ruinous
superfluities, as <em>you</em> do the superfluities of France;
since such a law would immediately be reported against
by your board of trade, and repealed by the crown:)
I say while these circumstances continue, and while
there subsists the established method of royal requisitions,
for raising money on them by their own assemblies
on every proper occasion; can it be necessary or
prudent to distress and vex them by taxes laid here, in
a parliament wherein they have no representative, and
in a manner which they look upon to be unconstitutional
and subversive of their most valuable rights; and
are they to be thought unreasonable and ungrateful if
they oppose such taxes? Wherewith, they say, shall we
show our loyalty to our gracious king, if our money is
to be given by others, without asking our consent?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
And if the parliament has a right thus to take from us
a penny in the pound, where is the line drawn that
bounds that right, and what shall hinder their calling
whenever they please for the other nineteen shillings
and eleven pence? Have we then any thing that we
can call our own? It is more than probable, that bringing
representatives from the colonies to sit and act here
as members of parliament, thus uniting and consolidating
your dominions, would in a little time <em>remove</em> these
objections and difficulties, and make the future government
of the colonies easy: but, till some such thing is
done, I apprehend no taxes, laid there by parliament
here, will ever be collected, but such as must be stained
with blood: and I am sure the profit of such taxes
will never answer the expence of collecting them, and
that the respect and affection of the Americans to this
country will in the struggle be totally lost, perhaps
never to be recovered; and therewith all the commercial
and political advantages, that might have attended
the continuance of this respect and this affection.</p>

<p>In my own private judgment I think an immediate
repeal of the stamp-act would be the best measure for
<em>this</em> country; but a suspension of it for three years, the
best for <em>that</em>. The <em>repeal</em> would fill them with joy and
gratitude, re-establish their respect and veneration for
parliament, restore at once their ancient and natural
love for this country, and their regard for every thing
that comes from it; hence the trade would be renewed
in all its branches; they would again indulge in all the
expensive superfluities you supply them with, and
their own new assumed home industry would languish.
But the <em>suspension</em>, though it might continue their fears
and anxieties, would at the same time keep up their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
resolutions of industry and frugality; which in two or
three years would grow into habits, to their lasting
advantage. However, as the repeal will probably not
be now agreed to,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> from what I think a mistaken opinion,
that the honour and dignity of government is
better supported by persisting in a wrong measure once
entered into, than by rectifying an error as soon as it is
discovered; we must allow the next best thing for the
advantage of both countries is, the suspension; for as
to executing the act by force, it is madness, and will be
ruin to the whole.</p>

<p>The rest of your friend's reasonings and propositions
appear to me truly just and judicious; I will therefore
only add, that I am as desirous of his acquaintance and
intimacy, as he was of my opinion.</p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>The following <em>objection</em> against communicating to
the colonies the rights, privileges, and powers of the
realm, as to parts of the realm, has been made. I have
been endeavouring to obviate it, and I communicate
[it] to you, in hopes of your promised assistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>If, <em>say the objectors</em>, we communicate to the colonies
the power of sending representatives, and in consequence
expect them to participate in an <em>equal share and
proportion</em> of all our taxes, we must grant to them all
the powers of trade and manufacturing, which any
other parts of the realm within the isle of Great Britain
enjoy: if so, perchance the profits of the Atlantic commerce
may converge to some centre in America; to
Boston, New-York, Philadelphia, or to some of the
isles: if so, then the natural and artificial produce of
the colonies, and in course of consequences the landed
interest of the colonies, will be promoted; while the
natural and artificial produce and landed interest of
Great Britain will be depressed, to its utter ruin and
destruction; and consequently the balance of the power
of government, although still <em>within the realm</em>, will be
<em>locally</em> transferred from Great Britain to the colonies.
Which consequence, however it may suit a citizen of
the world, must be folly and madness to a Briton.&mdash;My
fit is gone off, and though weak, both from the gout
and a concomitant and very ugly fever, I am much
better.&mdash;Would be glad to see you.</p>

<p>This <em>objection</em> goes upon the supposition, that whatever
the colonies gain, Britain must lose; and that if
the <em>colonies</em> can be kept from gaining an advantage,
<em>Britain will gain it</em>:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>If the colonies are fitter for a particular trade than
Britain, they should have it, and Britain apply to what
it is more fit for. The whole empire is a gainer. And
if Britain is not so fit or so well situated for a particular
advantage, <em>other</em> countries will get it, <em>if the colonies
do not</em>. Thus Ireland was forbid the woollen manufacture
and remains poor: but this has given to the
French the trade and wealth Ireland might have gained
for the British empire.</p>

<p>The government cannot <em>long</em> be retained without the
union. Which is best (supposing your case) to have
a total separation, or a change of the seat of government?&mdash;It
by no means follows, that promoting and
advancing the landed interest in America will depress
that of Britain: the contrary has always been the fact.
Advantageous situations and circumstances will always
secure and fix manufactures: Sheffield against all
Europe for these 300 years past.&mdash;</p>

the American Stamp Act.</em></a><a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></h3>

<p><em>Q.</em> What is your name, and place of abode?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Franklin, of Philadelphia.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>
<p><em>Q.</em> Do the Americans pay any considerable taxes
among themselves?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Certainly many, and very heavy taxes.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What are the present taxes in Pensylvania, laid
by the laws of the colony?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> There are taxes on all estates real and personal; a
poll tax; a tax on all offices, professions, trades and
businesses, according to their profits; an excise on all
wine, rum, and other spirits; and a duty of ten pounds
per head on all negroes imported, with some other duties.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> For what purposes are those taxes laid?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> For the support of the civil and military establishments
of the country, and to discharge the heavy debt
contracted in the last war.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> How long are those taxes to continue?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Those for discharging the debt are to continue
till 1772, and longer, if the debt should not be then all
discharged. The others must always continue.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Was it not expected that the debt would have
been sooner discharged?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p><em>A.</em> It was, when the peace was made with France
and Spain. But a fresh war breaking out with the
Indians, a fresh load of debt was incurred; and the
taxes, of course, continued longer by a new law.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Are not all the people very able to pay those
taxes?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No. The frontier counties, all along the continent,
having been frequently ravaged by the enemy
and greatly impoverished, are able to pay very little
tax. And therefore, in consideration of their distresses,
our late tax laws do expressly favour those counties,
excusing the sufferers; and I suppose the same is done
in other governments.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Are not you concerned in the management of
the <em>post-office</em> in America?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes. I am deputy post-master general of North
America.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Don't you think the distribution of stamps <em>by
post</em> to all the inhabitants very practicable, if there was
no opposition?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The posts only go along the sea-coasts; they do
not, except in a few instances, go back into the country;
and if they did, sending for stamps by post would
occasion an expence of postage, amounting, in many
cases, to much more than that of the stamps themselves.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Are you acquainted with Newfoundland?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I never was there.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Do you know whether there are any post-roads
on that island?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I have heard that there are no roads at all, but
that the communication between one settlement and
another is by sea only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Can you disperse the stamps by post in Canada?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> There is only a post between Montreal and Quebec.
The inhabitants live so scattered and remote
from each other in that vast country, that posts cannot
be supported among them, and therefore they cannot
get stamps per post. The <em>English colonies</em> too along
the frontiers are very thinly settled.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> From the thinness of the back settlements, would
not the stamp act be extremely inconvenient to the
inhabitants, if executed?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> To be sure it would; as many of the inhabitants
could not get stamps when they had occasion for them,
without taking long journeys, and spending perhaps
three or four pounds, that the crown might get six-pence.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Are not the colonies, from their circumstances,
very able to pay the stamp duty?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> In my opinion there is not gold and silver enough
in the colonies to pay the stamp duty for one year.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Don't you know that the money arising from the
stamps was all to be laid out in America?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>
<p><em>A.</em> I know it is appropriated by the act to the American
service; but it will be spent in the conquered colonies,
where the soldiers are; not in the colonies that
pay it.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Is there not a balance of trade due from the colonies
where the troops are posted, that will bring back
the money to the old colonies?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I think not. I believe very little would come
back. I know of no trade likely to bring it back. I
think it would come from the colonies where it was
spent, directly to England; for I have always observed,
that in every colony the more plenty the means of remittance
to England, the more goods are sent for, and
the more trade with England carried on.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What number of white inhabitants do you think
there are in Pensylvania?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I suppose there may be about one hundred and
sixty thousand.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What number of them are Quakers?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Perhaps a third.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What number of Germans?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Perhaps another third; but I cannot speak with
certainty.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Have any number of the Germans seen service,
as soldiers, in Europe?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes, many of them, both in Europe and America.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Are they as much dissatisfied with the stamp duty
as the English?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes, and more; and with reason, as their stamps
are, in many cases, to be double<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>
<p><em>Q.</em> How many white men do you suppose there are
in North America?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> About three hundred thousand, from sixteen to
sixty years of age<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What may be the amount of one year's imports
into Pensylvania from Britain?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I have been informed that our merchants compute
the imports from Britain to be above 500,000<em>l.</em></p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What may be the amount of the produce of your
province exported to Britain?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> It must be small, as we produce little that is wanted
in Britain. I suppose it cannot exceed 40,000<em>l.</em></p>

<p><em>Q.</em> How then do you pay the balance?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The balance is paid by our produce carried to
the West Indies (and sold in our own islands, or to the
French, Spaniards, Danes, and Dutch)&mdash;by the same
[produce] carried to other colonies in North America,
(as to New England, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Carolina,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
and Georgia)&mdash;by the same, carried to different
parts of Europe, (as Spain, Portugal, and Italy.) In
all which places we receive either money, bills of exchange,
or commodities that suit for remittance to Britain;
which, together with all the profits on the industry
of our merchants and mariners, arising in those circuitous
voyages, and the freights made by their ships,
centre finally in Britain to discharge the balance, and
pay for British manufactures continually used in the
province, or sold to foreigners by our traders.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Have you heard of any difficulties lately laid on
the Spanish trade?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes, I have heard that it has been greatly obstructed
by some new regulations, and by the English
men of war and cutters stationed all along the coast in
America.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Do you think it right that America should be
protected by this country, and pay no part of the expence?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> That is not the case. The colonies raised, clothed,
and paid, during the last war, near twenty-five thousand
men, and spent many millions.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Were you not reimbursed by parliament?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> We were only reimbursed what, in your opinion,
we had advanced beyond our proportion, or beyond
what might reasonably be expected from us; and it
was a very small part of what we spent. Pensylvania,
in particular, disbursed about 500,000<em>l.</em> and the reimbursements,
in the whole, did not exceed 60,000<em>l.</em></p>

<p><em>Q.</em> You have said, that you pay heavy taxes in Pensylvania,
what do they amount to in the pound?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The tax on all estates, real and personal, is eighteen
pence in the pound, fully rated; and the tax on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
the profits of trades and professions, with other taxes,
do, I suppose, make full half-a-crown in the pound.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Do you know any thing of the <em>rate of exchange in</em>
Pensylvania, and whether it has fallen lately?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> It is commonly from one hundred and seventy to
one hundred and seventy-five. I have heard, that it has
fallen lately from one hundred and seventy-five to one
hundred sixty-two and a half; owing, I suppose, to
their lessening their orders for goods; and when their
debts to this country are paid, I think the exchange
will probably be at par.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Do not you think the people of America would
submit to pay the stamp duty, if it was moderated?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No, never, unless compelled by force of arms.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Are not the taxes in Pensylvania laid on unequally,
in order to burthen the English trade; particularly
the tax on professions and business?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> It is not more burthensome in proportion, than
the tax on lands. It is intended, and supposed to take
an equal proportion of profits.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> How is the assembly composed? Of what kinds
of people are the members; landholders or traders?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> It is composed of landholders, merchants, and
artificers.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Are not the majority landholders?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I believe they are.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Do not they, as much as possible, shift the tax off
from the land, to ease that, and lay the burthen heavier
on trade?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I have never understood it so. I never heard
such a thing suggested. And indeed an attempt of
that kind could answer no purpose. The merchant or
trader is always skilled in figures, and ready with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
pen and ink. If unequal burthens are laid on his trade,
he puts an additional price on his goods; and the consumers,
who are chiefly landholders, finally pay the
greatest part, if not the whole.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What was the temper of America towards Great
Britain <em>before the year</em> 1763<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The best in the world. They submitted willingly
to the government of the crown, and paid, in their
courts, obedience to acts of parliament. Numerous as
the people are in the several old provinces, they cost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
you nothing in forts, citadels, garrisons, or armies, to
keep them in subjection. They were governed by this
country at the expence only of a little pen, ink, and
paper: they were led by a thread. They had not only
a respect, but an affection for Great Britain; for its
laws, its customs, and manners, and even a fondness for
its fashions, that greatly increased the commerce. Natives
of Britain were always treated with particular regard;
to be an <em>Old England-man</em> was, of itself, a character
of some respect, and gave a kind of rank
among us.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> And what is their temper now?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> O, very much altered.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Did you ever hear the authority of parliament to
make laws for America questioned till lately?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The authority of parliament was allowed to be
valid in all laws, except such as should lay internal taxes.
It was never disputed in laying duties to regulate commerce.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> In what proportion hath population increased in
America?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I think the inhabitants of all the provinces together,
taken at a medium, double in about twenty-five
years. But their demand for British manufactures increases
much faster; as the consumption is not merely
in proportion to their numbers, but grows with the
growing abilities of the same numbers to pay for them.
In 1723, the whole importation from Britain to Pensylvania
was but about 15,000<em>l.</em> sterling; it is now near
half a million.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> In what light did the people of America use to
consider the parliament of Great Britain?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> They considered the parliament as the great bulwark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
and security of their liberties and privileges, and
always spoke of it with the utmost respect and veneration.
Arbitrary ministers, they thought, might possibly,
at times, attempt to oppress them; but they relied
on it, that the parliament, on application, would always
give redress. They remembered, with gratitude, a
strong instance of this, when a bill was brought into
parliament, with a clause, to make royal instructions
laws in the colonies, which the house of commons
would not pass, and it was thrown out.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> And have they not still the same respect for parliament?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No, it is greatly lessened.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> To what causes is that owing?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> To a concurrence of causes; the restraints lately
laid on their trade, by which the bringing of foreign
gold and silver into [the] colonies was prevented; the
prohibition of making paper-money among themselves,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
and then demanding a new and heavy tax by
stamps, taking away, at the same time, trials by juries,
and refusing to receive and hear their humble petitions.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Don't you think they would submit to the stamp
act, if it was modified, the obnoxious parts taken out,
and the duty reduced to some particulars, of small moment?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No, they will never submit to it.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What do you think is the reason that the people
in America increase faster than in England?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Because they marry younger, and more generally.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Why so?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>
<p><em>A.</em> Because any young couple, that are industrious,
may easily obtain land of their own, on which they can
raise a family.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Are not the lower rank of people more at their
ease in America than in England?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> They may be so, if they are sober and diligent;
as they are better paid for their labour.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What is your opinion of a future tax, imposed on
the same principle with that of the stamp act? how
would the Americans receive it?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Just as they do this. They would not pay it.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Have not you heard of the resolutions of this
house, and of the house of lords, asserting the right of
parliament relating to America, including a power to
tax the people there?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes, I have heard of such resolutions.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What will be the opinion of the Americans on
those resolutions?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> They will think them unconstitutional and unjust.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Was it an opinion in America before 1763, that
the parliament had no right to lay taxes and duties
there?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I never heard any objection to the right of laying
duties to regulate commerce, but a right to lay internal
taxes was never supposed to be in parliament, as we are
not represented there.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> On what do you found your opinion, that the
people in America made any such distinction?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I know that whenever the subject has occurred
in conversation where I have been present, it has appeared
to be the opinion of every one, that we could
not be taxed in a parliament where we were not represented.
But the payment of duties laid by act of parliament
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
as regulations of commerce, was never disputed.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But can you name any act of assembly, or public
act of any of your governments, that made such distinction?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I do not know that there was any; I think there
was never an occasion to make any such act, till now
that you have attempted to tax us: <em>that</em> has occasioned
resolutions of assembly, declaring the distinction, in
which I think every assembly on the continent, and
every member in every assembly, have been unanimous.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What then could occasion conversations on that
subject before that time?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> There was in 1754 a proposition made (I think it
came from hence) that in case of a war, which was then
apprehended, the governors of the colonies should
meet, and order the levying of troops, building of forts,
and taking every other necessary measure for the general
defence; and should draw on the treasury here
for the sums expended; which were afterwards to be
raised in the colonies by a general tax, to be laid on
them by <em>act of parliament</em>. This occasioned a good
deal of conversation on the subject; and the general
opinion was, that the parliament neither would nor
could lay any tax on us, till we were duly represented
in parliament; because it was not just, nor agreeable
to the nature of an English constitution.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Don't you know there was a time in New York,
when it was under consideration to make an application
to parliament to lay taxes on that colony, upon a deficiency
arising from the assembly's refusing or neglecting
to raise the necessary supplies for the support of the
civil government?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p><em>A.</em> I never heard of it.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> There was such an application under consideration
in New York:&mdash;and do you apprehend they could
suppose the right of parliament to lay a tax in America
was only local, and confined to the case of a deficiency
in a particular colony, by a refusal of its assembly to
raise the necessary supplies?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> They could not suppose such a case, as that the
assembly would not raise the necessary supplies to support
its own government. An assembly that would refuse
it must want common sense; which cannot be supposed.
I think there was never any such case at New
York, and that it must be a misrepresentation, or the
fact must be misunderstood. I know there have been
some attempts, by ministerial instructions from hence,
to oblige the assemblies to settle permanent salaries on
governors, which they wisely refused to do; but I believe
no assembly of New York, or any other colony,
ever refused duly to support government by proper allowances,
from time to time, to public officers.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But in case a governor, acting by instruction,
should call on an assembly to raise the necessary supplies,
and the assembly should refuse to do it, do you
not think it would then be for the good of the people
of the colony, as well as necessary to government, that
the parliament should tax them?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I do not think it would be necessary. If an assembly
could possibly be so absurd, as to refuse raising
the supplies requisite for the maintenance of government
among them, they could not long remain in such
a situation; the disorders and confusion occasioned by
it must soon bring them to reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Q.</em> If it should not, ought not the right to be in
Great Britain of applying a remedy?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> A right, only to be used in such a case, I should
have no objection to; supposing it to be used merely
for the good of the people of the colony.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But who is to judge of that, Britain or the
colony?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Those that feel can best judge.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> You say the colonies have always submitted to
external taxes, and object to the right of parliament
only in laying internal taxes; now can you show, that
there is any kind of <em>difference between the two taxes</em> to
the colony on which they may be laid?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I think the difference is very great. An <em>external</em>
tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty
is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity,
and, when it is offered to sale, makes a part of
the price. If the people do not like it at that price,
they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an
<em>internal</em> tax is forced from the people without their consent,
if not laid by their own representatives. The
stamp act says, we shall have no commerce, make
no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase
nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither
marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such
sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from
us, or ruin us by the consequences of refusing to pay it.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But supposing the external tax or duty to be laid
on the necessaries of life imported into your colony,
will not that be the same thing in its effects as an internal
tax?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I do not know a single article imported into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
<em>northern</em> colonies, but what they can either do without,
or make themselves.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Don't you think cloth from England absolutely
necessary to them?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No, by no means absolutely necessary; with industry
and good management, they may very well supply
themselves with all they want.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Will it not take a long time to establish that manufacture
among them; and must they not in the mean
while suffer greatly?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I think not. They have made a surprising progress
already. And I am of opinion, that before their
old clothes are worn out, they will have new ones of
their own making.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Can they possibly find wool enough in North
America?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> They have taken steps to increase the wool.
They entered into general combinations to eat no more
lamb; and very few lambs were killed last year. This
course, persisted in, will soon make a prodigious difference
in the quantity of wool. And the establishing of
great manufactories, like those in the clothing towns
here, is not necessary, as it is where the business is to
be carried on for the purposes of trade. The people
will all spin, and work for themselves, in their own
houses.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Can there be wool and manufacture enough in
one or two years?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> In three years, I think there may.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Does not the severity of the winter, in the northern
colonies, occasion the wool to be of bad quality?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No, the wool is very fine and good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Q.</em> In the more southern colonies, as in Virginia,
don't you know, that the wool is coarse, and only a kind
of hair?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I don't know it. I never heard it. Yet I have
been sometimes in Virginia. I cannot say I ever took
particular notice of the wool there, but I believe it is
good, though I cannot speak positively of it; but Virginia,
and the colonies south of it, have less occasion
for wool; their winters are short, and not very severe;
and they can very well clothe themselves with linen and
cotton of their own raising for the rest of the year.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Are not the people in the more northern colonies
obliged to fodder their sheep all the winter?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> In some of the most northern colonies they may
be obliged to do it, some part of the winter.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Considering the resolutions of parliament<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>, <em>as to
the right</em>; do you think, if the stamp act is repealed,
that the North Americans will be satisfied?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I believe they will.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Why do you think so?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I think the resolutions of <em>right</em> will give them
very little concern, if they are never attempted to be
carried into practice. The colonies will probably consider
themselves in the same situation, in that respect,
with Ireland: they know you claim the same right with
regard to Ireland, but you never exercise it. And they
may believe you never will exercise it in the colonies,
any more than in Ireland, unless on some very extraordinary
occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>
<p><em>Q.</em> But who are to be the judges of that extraordinary
occasion? Is not the parliament?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Though the parliament may judge of the occasion,
the people will think it can never exercise such
right, till representatives from the colonies are admitted
into parliament; and that, whenever the occasion arises,
representatives <em>will</em> be ordered.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Did you never hear that Maryland, during the
last war, had refused to furnish a quota towards the
common defence?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Maryland has been much misrepresented in that
matter. Maryland, to my knowledge, never refused to
contribute, or grant aids to the crown. The assemblies,
every year during the war, voted considerable
sums, and formed bills to raise them. The bills were,
according to the constitution of that province, sent up
to the council, or upper house, for concurrence, that
they might be presented to the governor, in order to
be enacted into laws. Unhappy disputes between the
two houses&mdash;arising from the defects of that constitution
principally&mdash;rendered all the bills but one or two
abortive. The proprietary's council rejected them. It
is true, Maryland did contribute its proportion; but it
was, in my opinion, the fault of the government, not of
the people.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Was it not talked of in the other provinces as
a proper measure, to apply to parliament to compel
them?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I have heard such discourse; but as it was well
known, that the people were not to blame, no such application
was ever made, nor any step taken towards it.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Was it not proposed at a public meeting?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Not that I know of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Do you remember the abolishing of the paper-currency
in New England, by act of assembly?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I do remember its being abolished in the Massachusett's
Bay.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Was not lieutenant-governor Hutchinson principally
concerned in that transaction?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I have heard so.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Was it not at that time a very unpopular law?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I believe it might, though I can say little about
it, as I lived at a distance from that province.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Was not the <em>scarcity of gold and silver</em> an argument
used against abolishing the paper?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I suppose it was<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What is the present opinion there of that law? Is
it as unpopular as it was at first?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I think it is not.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Have not instructions from hence been sometimes
sent over to governors, highly oppressive and unpolitical?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Have not some governors dispensed with them
for that reason?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes, I have heard so.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Did the Americans ever dispute the controling
power of parliament to regulate the commerce?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Can any thing less than a military force carry the
stamp act into execution?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I do not see how a military force can be applied
to that purpose.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Why may it not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>
<p><em>A.</em> Suppose a military force sent into America, they
will find nobody in arms; what are they then to do?
They cannot force a man to take stamps who chooses
to do without them. They will not find a rebellion:
they may indeed make one.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> If the act is not repealed, what do you think will
be the consequences?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> A total loss of the respect and affection the people
of America bear to this country, and of all the commerce
that depends on that respect and affection.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> How can the commerce be affected?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> You will find, that if the act is not repealed, they
will take very little of your manufactures in a short
time.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Is it in their power to do without them?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I think they may very well do without them.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Is it their interest not to take them?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The goods they take from Britain are either necessaries,
mere conveniences, or superfluities. The
first, as cloth, &amp;c. with a little industry they can make
at home; the second they can do without, till they are
able to provide them among themselves; and the last,
which are much the greatest part, they will strike off
immediately. They are mere articles of fashion, purchased
and consumed, because the fashion in a respected
country; but will now be detested and rejected.
The people have already struck off, by general agreement,
the use of all goods fashionable in mournings,
and many thousand pounds worth are sent back as unsaleable.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Is it their interest to make cloth at home?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I think they may at present get it cheaper from
Britain, I mean of the same fineness and neatness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
workmanship: but when one considers other circumstances,
the restraints on their trade, and the difficulty
of making remittances, it is their interest to make every
thing.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Suppose an act of internal regulations connected
with a tax, how would they receive it?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I think it would be objected to.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Then no regulation with a tax would be submitted
to?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Their opinion is, that when aids to the crown are
wanted, they are to be asked of the several assemblies,
according to the old established usage; who will, as
they always have done, grant them freely. And that
their money ought not to be given away, without their
consent, by persons at a distance, unacquainted with
their circumstances and abilities. The granting aids
to the crown is the only means they have of recommending
themselves to their sovereign; and they think
it extremely hard and unjust, that a body of men, in
which they have no representatives, should make a
merit to itself of giving and granting what is not its
own, but theirs; and deprive them of a right they
esteem of the utmost value and importance, as it is the
security of all their other rights.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But is not the post-office, which they have long
received, a tax as well as a regulation?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No; the money paid for the postage of a letter is
not of the nature of a tax; it is merely a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quantum meruit</i>
for a service done; no person is compellable to pay the
money, if he does not choose to receive the service. A
man may still, as before the act, send his letter by a
servant, a special messenger, or a friend, if he thinks it
cheaper and safer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But do they not consider the regulations of the
post-office, by the act of last year, as a tax?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> By the regulations of last year the rate of postage
was generally abated near thirty per cent through all
America; they certainly cannot consider such abatement
<em>as a tax</em>.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> If an excise was laid by parliament, which they
might likewise avoid paying, by not consuming the articles
excised, would they then not object to it?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> They would certainly object to it, as an excise is
unconnected with any service done, and is merely an
aid, which they think ought to be asked of them, and
granted by them, if they are to pay it; and can be
granted for them by no others whatsoever, whom they
have not impowered for that purpose.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> You say, they do not object to the right of parliament,
in laying duties on goods to be paid on their importation:
now, is there any kind of difference between
a duty on the <em>importation</em> of goods, and an excise on their
<em>consumption</em>?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes; a very material one: an excise, for the
reasons I have just mentioned, they think you can have
no right to lay within their country. But <em>the sea</em> is
yours; you maintain, by your fleets, the safety of navigation
in it, and keep it clear of pirates; you may have
therefore a natural and equitable right to some <em>toll</em> or
duty on merchandizes carried through that part of your
dominions, towards defraying the expence you are at
in ships to maintain the safety of that carriage.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Does this reasoning hold in the case of a duty
laid on the produce of their lands <em>exported</em>? And would
they not then object to such a duty?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> If it tended to make the produce so much dearer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
abroad, as to lessen the demand for it, to be sure they
would object to such a duty; not to your right of laying
it, but they would complain of it as a burthen, and
petition you to lighten it.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Is not the duty paid on the tobacco exported, a
duty of that kind?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> That, I think, is only on tobacco carried coast-wise,
from one colony to another, and appropriated as a
fund for supporting the college at Williamsburgh, in
Virginia.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Have not the assemblies in the West Indies the
same natural rights with those in North America?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Undoubtedly.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> And is there not a tax laid there on their sugars
exported?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I am not much acquainted with the West Indies;
but the duty of four and a half per cent on sugars exported
was, I believe, granted by their own assemblies.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p><em>Q.</em> How much is the poll-tax in your province laid
on unmarried men?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> It is, I think, fifteen shillings, to be paid by every
single freeman, upwards of twenty-one years old.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What is the annual amount of <em>all</em> the taxes in
Pensylvania?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I suppose about 20,000<em>l.</em> sterling.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Snpposing'">Supposing</ins> the stamp act continued and enforced,
do you imagine that ill-humour will induce the Americans
to give as much for worse manufactures of their
own, and use them, preferably to better of ours?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes, I think so. People will pay as freely to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
gratify one passion as another, their resentment as their
pride.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Would the people at Boston discontinue their
trade?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The merchants are a very small number compared
with the body of the people, and must discontinue
their trade, if nobody will buy their goods.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What are the body of the people in the colonies?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> They are farmers, husbandmen, or planters.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Would they suffer the produce of their lands to
rot?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No; but they would not raise so much. They
would manufacture more, and plow less.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Would they live without the administration of
justice in civil matters, and suffer all the inconveniencies
of such a situation for any considerable time, rather
than take the stamps, supposing the stamps were protected
by a sufficient force, where every one might have
them?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I think the supposition impracticable, that the
stamps should be so protected as that every one might
have them. The act requires sub-distributors to be
appointed in every county town, district, and village,
and they would be necessary. But the <em>principal</em> distributors,
who were to have had a considerable profit on
the whole, have not thought it worth while to continue
in the office; and I think it impossible to find sub-distributors
fit to be trusted, who, for the trifling profit
that must come to their share, would incur the odium,
and run the hazard that would attend it; and if they
could be found, I think it impracticable to protect the
stamps in so many distant and remote places.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But in places where they could be protected,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
would not the people use them, rather than remain in
such a situation, unable to obtain any right, or recover,
by law, any debt?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> It is hard to say what they would do. I can only
judge what other people will think, and how they will
act, by what I feel within myself. I have a great many
debts due to me in America, and I had rather they
should remain unrecoverable by any law, than submit
to the stamp act. They will be debts of honour. It
is my opinion the people will either continue in that
situation, or find some way to extricate themselves,
perhaps by generally agreeing to proceed in the courts
without stamps.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What do you think a sufficient military force to
protect the distribution of the stamps in every part of
America?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> A very great force, I can't say what, if the disposition
of America is for a general resistance.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What is the number of men in America able to
bear arms, or of disciplined militia?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> There are, I suppose, at least&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>[<em>Question objected to. He withdrew. Called in
again.</em>]</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Is the American stamp act an equal tax on the
country?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I think not.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Why so?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The greatest part of the money must arise from
law-suits for the recovery of debts, and be paid by the
lower sort of people, who were too poor easily to pay
their debts. It is therefore a heavy tax on the poor,
and a tax upon them for being poor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But will not this increase of expence be a means
of lessening the number of law-suits?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I think not; for as the costs all fall upon the
debtor, and are to be paid by him, they would be no
discouragement to the creditor to bring his action.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Would it not have the effect of excessive usury?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes, as an oppression of the debtor.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> How many ships are there laden annually in
North America with <em>flax-seed</em> for Ireland?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I cannot speak to the number of ships, but I
know, that in 1752 ten thousand hogsheads of flax-seed,
each containing seven bushels, were exported from
Philadelphia to Ireland. I suppose the quantity is
greatly increased since that time, and it is understood,
that the exportation from New York is equal to that
from Philadelphia.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What becomes of the flax that grows with that
flax-seed?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> They manufacture some into coarse, and some
into a middling kind of linen.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Are there any <em>slitting-mills</em> in America?<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p><em>A.</em> I think there are three, but I believe only one at
present employed. I suppose they will all be set to
work, if the interruption of the trade continues.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Are there any <em>fulling-mills</em> there?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> A great many.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Did you never hear, that a great quantity of
stockings were contracted for, for the army, during the
war, and manufactured in Philadelphia?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I have heard so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>
<p><em>Q.</em> If the stamp-act should be repealed, would not
the Americans think they could oblige the parliament
to repeal every external tax-law now in force?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> It is hard to answer questions of what people at
such a distance will think.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But what do you imagine they will think were
the motives of repealing the act?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I suppose they will think, that it was repealed
from a conviction of its inexpediency; and they will
rely upon it, that while the same inexpediency subsists,
you will never attempt to make such another.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What do you mean by its inexpediency?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I mean its inexpediency on several accounts, the
poverty and inability of those who were to pay the tax,
the general discontent it has occasioned, and the impracticability
of enforcing it.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> If the act should be repealed, and the legislature
should show its resentment to the opposers of the
stamp-act, would the colonies acquiesce in the authority
of the legislature? What is your opinion they
would do?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I don't doubt at all, that if the legislature repeal
the stamp-act, the colonies will acquiesce in the authority.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But if the legislature should think fit to ascertain
its right to lay taxes, by any act laying a small tax,
contrary to their opinion, would they submit to pay
the tax?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The proceedings of the people in America have
been considered too much together. The proceedings
of the assemblies have been very different from those
of the mobs, and should be distinguished, as having no
connection with each other. The <em>assemblies</em> have only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
peaceably resolved what they take to be their rights:
they have taken no measures for opposition by force,
they have not built a fort, raised a man, or provided a
grain of ammunition, in order to such opposition. The
ring-leaders of riots, they think ought to be punished;
they would punish them themselves, if they could.
Every sober, sensible man would wish to see rioters
punished, as otherwise peaceable people have no security
of person or estate.&mdash;But as to an internal tax, how
small soever, laid by the legislature here on the people
there, while they have no representatives in this legislature,
I think it will never be submitted to: they will
oppose it to the last.&mdash;They do not consider it as at all
necessary for you to raise money on them by your
taxes; because they are, and always have been, ready
to raise money by taxes among themselves, and to
grant large sums, equal to their abilities, upon requisition
from the crown. They have not only granted
equal to their abilities, but, during all the last war, they
granted far beyond their abilities, and beyond their
proportion with this country (you yourselves being
judges) to the amount of many hundred thousand
pounds; and this they did freely and readily, only on a
sort of promise, from the secretary of state, that it
should be recommended to parliament to make them
compensation. It was accordingly recommended to
parliament, in the most honourable manner for them.
America has been greatly misrepresented and abused
here, in papers, and pamphlets, and speeches, as ungrateful,
and unreasonable, and unjust; in having put
this nation to immense expence for their defence, and
refusing to bear any part of that expence. The colonies
raised, paid, and clothed, near twenty-five thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
men during the last war; a number equal to those sent
from Britain, and far beyond their proportion; they
went deeply into debt in doing this, and all their taxes
and estates are mortgaged, for many years to come, for
discharging that debt. Government here was at that
time very sensible of this. The colonies were recommended
to parliament. Every year the king sent down
to the house a written message to this purpose, "that
his majesty, being highly sensible of the zeal and vigour
with which his faithful subjects in North America had
exerted themselves, in defence of his majesty's just
rights and possessions; recommended it to the house
to take the same into consideration, and enable him to
give them a proper compensation." You will find
those messages on your own journals every year of the
war to the very last; and you did accordingly give
200,000<em>l.</em> annually to the crown, to be distributed in
such compensation to the colonies. This is the strongest
of all proofs that the colonies, far from being unwilling
to bear a share of the burthen, did exceed their
proportion; for if they had done less, or had only
equalled their proportion, there would have been no
room or reason for compensation. Indeed the sums,
reimbursed them, were by no means adequate to the
expence they incurred beyond their proportion: but
they never murmured at that; they esteemed their
sovereign's approbation of their zeal and fidelity, and
the approbation of this house, far beyond any other
kind of compensation, therefore there was no occasion
for this act, to force money from a willing people: they
had not refused giving money for the <em>purposes</em> of the
act, no requisition had been made, they were always
willing and ready to do what could reasonably be expected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
from them, and in this light they wish to be
considered.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But suppose Great Britain should be engaged in
a <em>war in Europe</em>, would North America contribute to
the support of it?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I do think they would, as far as their circumstances
would permit. They consider themselves as a
part of the British empire, and as having one common
interest with it: they may be looked on here as foreigners,
but they do not consider themselves as such. They
are zealous for the honour and prosperity of this nation;
and, while they are well used, will always be ready to
support it, as far as their little power goes.&mdash;In 1739
they were called upon to assist in the expedition against
Carthagena, and they sent three thousand men to join
your army.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> It is true Carthagena is in America, but
as remote from the northern colonies, as if it had been
in Europe. They make no distinction of wars, as to
their duty of assisting in them. I know the <em>last war</em> is
commonly spoken of here as entered into for the defence,
or for the sake of the people in America. I think it is
quite misunderstood. It began about the limits between
Canada and Nova Scotia; about territories to
which the <em>crown</em> indeed laid claim, but [which] were
not claimed by any British <em>colony</em>; none of the lands
had been granted to any colonist, we had therefore no
particular concern or interest in that dispute.&mdash;As to
the Ohio, the contest there began about your right of
trading in the Indian country, a right you had by the
treaty of Utretcht, which the French infringed; they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
seized the traders and their goods, which were your
manufactures; they took a fort which a company of
your merchants, and their factors and correspondents
had erected there, to secure that trade. Braddock
was sent with an army to re-take that fort (which was
looked on here as another incroachment on the king's
territory) and to protect your trade. It was not till
after his defeat that the colonies were attacked.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> They
were before in perfect peace with both French and
Indians; the troops were not therefore sent for their
defence. The trade with the Indians, though carried
on in America, is not an <em>American interest</em>. The people
of America are chiefly farmers and planters, scarce
any thing that they raise or produce is an article of
commerce with the Indians. The Indian trade is a
<em>British interest</em>; it is carried on with British manufactures,
for the profit of British merchants and manufacturers;
therefore the war, as it commenced for the
defence of territories of the crown (the property of no
American) and for the defence of a trade purely British,
was really a British war&mdash;and yet the people of America
made no scruple of contributing their utmost
towards carrying it on, and bringing it to a happy conclusion.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Do you think then that the taking possession of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
the king's territorial rights, and <em>strengthening the frontiers</em>,
is not an American interest?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Not particularly, but conjointly a British and an
American interest.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> You will not deny that the preceding war, the
<em>war with Spain</em>, was entered into for the sake of America;
was it not <em>occasioned by captures made in the American</em>
seas?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes; captures of ships carrying on the British
trade there with British manufactures.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Was not the <em>late war with the</em> Indians, <em>since the
peace with France</em>, a war for America only?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes; it was more particularly for America than
the former; but it was rather a consequence or remains
of the former war, the Indians not having been thoroughly
pacified; and the Americans bore by much the
greatest share of the expence. It was put an end to
by the army under General Bouquet; there were not
above three hundred regulars in that army, and above
one thousand Pensylvanians.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Is it not necessary to send troops to America, to
defend the Americans against the Indians?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No, by no means; it never was necessary. They
defended themselves when they were but an handful,
and the Indians much more numerous. They continually
gained ground, and have driven the Indians over
the mountains, without any troops sent to their assistance
from this country. And can it be thought necessary
now to send troops for their defence from those
diminished Indian tribes, when the colonies are become
so populous, and so strong? There is not the least occasion
for it, they are very able to defend themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Do you say there were no more than three hundred
regular troops employed in the late Indian war?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Not on the Ohio, or the frontiers of Pensylvania,
which was the chief part of the war that affected the
colonies. There were garrisons at Niagara, Fort Detroit,
and those remote posts kept for the sake of your
trade; I did not reckon them; but I believe that on
the whole the number of Americans, or provincial
troops, employed in the war, was greater than that of
the regulars. I am not certain, but I think so.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Do you think the assemblies have a right to levy
money on the subject there, to grant <em>to the crown</em>?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I certainly think so, they have always done it.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Are they acquainted with the declaration of
rights? And do they know that, by that statute, money
is not to be raised on the subject but by consent of parliament?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> They are very well acquainted with it.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> How then can they think they have a right to
levy money for the crown, or for any other than local
purposes?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> They understand that clause to relate to subjects
only within the realm; that no money can be levied on
them for the crown, but by consent of parliament.
<em>The colonies</em> are not supposed to be within the realm;
they have assemblies of their own, which are their parliaments,
and they are, in that respect, in the same
situation with Ireland. When money is to be raised
for the crown upon the subject in Ireland, or in the
colonies, the consent is given in the parliament of
Ireland, or in the assemblies of the colonies. They
think the parliament of Great Britain cannot properly
give that consent, till it has representatives from America;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
for the petition of right expressly says, it is to be
by <em>common consent in parliament</em>; and the people of
America have no representatives in parliament, to make
a part of that common consent.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> If the stamp act should be repealed, and an act
should pass, ordering the assemblies of the colonies to
indemnify the sufferers by the riots, would they obey
it?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> That is a question I cannot answer.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Suppose the king should require the colonies to
grant a revenue, and the parliament should be against
their doing it, do they think they can grant a revenue
to the king, <em>without</em> the consent of the parliament of
Great Britain?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> That is a deep question. As to my own opinion,
I should think myself at liberty to do it, and should do
it, if I liked the occasion.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> When money has been raised in the colonies,
upon requisitions, has it not been granted to the king?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes, always; but the requisitions have generally
been for some service expressed, as to raise, clothe, and
pay troops, and not for money only.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> If the act should pass, requiring the American
assemblies to make compensation to the sufferers, and
they should disobey it, and then the parliament should,
by another act, lay an internal tax, would they then
obey it?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The people will pay no internal tax; and I think
an act to oblige the assemblies to make compensation
is unnecessary; for I am of opinion, that as soon as the
present heats are abated, they will take the matter into
consideration, and if it is right to be done, they will do
it of themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Do not letters often come into the post-offices in
America directed to some inland town where no post
goes?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Can any private person take up those letters and
carry them as directed?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes; any friend of the person may do it, paying
the postage that has accrued.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But must not he pay an additional postage for
the distance to such inland town?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Can the post-master answer delivering the letter,
without being paid such additional postage?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Certainly he can demand nothing, where he does
no service.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Suppose a person, being far from home, finds a
letter in a post-office directed to him, and he lives in a
place to which the post generally goes, and the letter is
directed to that place, will the post-master deliver him
the letter, without his paying the postage receivable at
the place to which the letter is directed?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes; the office cannot demand postage for a
letter that it does not carry, or farther than it does
carry it.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Are not ferrymen in America obliged, by act of
parliament, to carry over the posts without pay?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Is not this a tax on the ferrymen?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> They do not consider it as such, as they have an
advantage from persons travelling with the post.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> If the stamp-act should be repealed, and the
crown should make a requisition to the colonies for a
sum of money, would they grant it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p><em>A.</em> I believe they would.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Why do you think so?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I can speak for the colony I live in; I had it in
<em>instruction</em> from the assembly to assure the ministry,
that as they always had done, so they should always
think it their duty, to grant such aids to the crown as
were suitable to their circumstances and abilities, whenever
called upon for that purpose, in the usual constitutional
manner; and I had the honour of communicating
this instruction to that honourable gentleman
then minister.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Would they do this for a British concern, as
suppose a war in some part of Europe, that did not
affect them?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>
<p><em>A.</em> Yes, for any thing that concerned the general
interest. They consider themselves as part of the
whole.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What is the usual constitutional manner of calling
on the colonies for aids?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> A letter from the secretary of state.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Is this all you mean; a letter from the secretary
of state?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I mean the usual way of requisition, in a circular
letter from the secretary of state, by his majesty's command,
reciting the occasion, and recommending it to
the colonies to grant such aids as became their loyalty,
and were suitable to their abilities.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Did the secretary of state ever write for <em>money</em>
for the crown?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The requisitions have been to raise, clothe, and
pay men, which cannot be done without money.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Would they grant money alone, if called on?</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'T. In my opinion'"><em>A.</em> In my opinion</ins> they would, money as well as men,
when they have money, or can make it.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> If the parliament should repeal the stamp act,
will the assembly of Pensylvania rescind their resolutions?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I think not.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Before there was any thought of the stamp act,
did they wish for a representation in parliament?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Don't you know that there is, in the Pensylvanian
charter, an express reservation of the right of parliament
to lay taxes there?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I know there is a clause in the charter, by which
the king grants that he will levy no taxes on the inhabitants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
unless it be with the consent of the assembly,
or by act of parliament.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> How then could the assembly of Pensylvania assert,
that laying a tax on them by the stamp act was
an infringement of their rights?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> They understand it thus: by the same charter,
and otherwise, they are intitled to all the privileges and
liberties of Englishmen; they find in the great charters,
and the petition and declaration of rights, that one of
the privileges of English subjects is, that they are not
to be taxed but by their <em>common consent</em>; they have
therefore relied upon it, from the first settlement of the
province, that the parliament never would, nor could,
by colour of that clause in the charter, assume a right
of taxing them, <em>till</em> it had qualified itself to exercise
such right, by admitting representatives from the people
to be taxed, who ought to make a part of that common
consent.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Are there any words in the charter that justify
that construction?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The common rights of Englishmen, as declared
by Magna Charta, and the petition of right, all justify
it.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Does the distinction between internal and external
taxes exist in the words of the charter?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No, I believe not.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Then may they not, by the same interpretation,
object to the parliament's right of external taxation?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> They never <em>have</em> hitherto. Many arguments
have been lately used here to show them that there is
no difference, and that if you have no right to tax them
internally, you have none to tax them externally, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
make any other law to bind them. At present they do
not reason so; but in time they may possibly be convinced
by these arguments.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Do not the resolutions of the Pensylvania assembly
say&mdash;all taxes?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> If they do, they mean only internal taxes; the
same words have not always the same meaning here
and in the colonies. By taxes they mean internal
taxes; by duties they mean customs; these are their
ideas of the language.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Have you not seen the resolutions of the Massachusett's
Bay assembly?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I have.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Do they not say, that neither external nor internal
taxes can be laid on them by parliament?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I don't know that they do; I believe not.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> If the same colony should say, neither tax nor
imposition could be laid, does not that province hold
the power of parliament can lay neither?</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Q. I suppose'"><em>A.</em> I suppose</ins> that by the word imposition, they do
not intend to express duties to be laid on goods imported,
as <em>regulations of commerce</em>.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What can the colonies mean then by imposition
as distinct from taxes?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> They may mean many things, as impressing of
men, or of carriages, quartering troops on private
houses, and the like; there may be great impositions
that are not properly taxes.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Is not the post-office rate an internal tax laid by
act of parliament?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I have answered that.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Are all parts of the colonies equally able to pay
taxes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p><em>A.</em> No, certainly; the frontier parts, which have
been ravaged by the enemy, are greatly disabled by
that means; and therefore, in such cases, are usually
favoured in our tax-laws.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Can we, at this distance, be competent judges of
what favours are necessary?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The parliament have supposed it, by claiming a
right to make tax-laws for America; I think it impossible.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Would the repeal of the stamp act be any discouragement
of your manufactures? Will the people that
have begun to manufacture decline it?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes, I think they will; especially if, at the same
time, the trade is opened again, so that remittances can
be easily made. I have known several instances that
make it probable. In the war before last, tobacco being
low, and making little remittance, the people of Virginia
went generally into family-manufactures. Afterwards,
when tobacco bore a better price, they returned
to the use of British manufactures. So fulling-mills
were very much disused in the last war in Pensylvania,
because bills were then plenty, and remittances could
easily be made to Britain for English cloth and other
goods.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> If the stamp act should be repealed, would it induce
the assemblies of America to acknowledge the
rights of parliament to tax them, and would they erase
their resolutions?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No, never.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Are there no means of obliging them to erase
those resolutions?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> None that I know of; they will never do it, unless
compelled by force of arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Is there a power on earth that can force them to
erase them?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No power, how great soever, can force men to
change their opinions.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Do they consider the post-office as a tax, or as a
regulation?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Not as a tax, but as a regulation and conveniency;
<em>every assembly</em> encouraged it, and supported it in
its infancy, by grants of money, which they would not
otherwise have done; and the people have always paid
the postage.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> When did you receive the instructions you mentioned?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I brought them with me, when I came to England,
about fifteen months since.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> When did you communicate that instruction to
the minister?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Soon after my arrival,&mdash;while the stamping of
America was under consideration, and <em>before</em> the bill
was brought in.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Would it be most for the interest of Great Britain,
to employ the hands of Virginia in tobacco, or in
manufactures?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> In tobacco, to be sure.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What used to be the pride of the Americans?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> To indulge in the fashions and manufactures of
Great Britain.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What is now their pride?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> To wear their old clothes over again, till they can
make new ones.</p>

<p><em>Withdrew.</em></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_83_83" id="Footnote_83_83"></a><a href="#FNanchor_83_83"><span class="label">[83]</span></a> 1766. Feb. 3. Benjamin Franklin, Esq. and a number of other persons
were "ordered to attend the committee of the whole house [of commons]
to whom it was referred, to consider farther the several papers
[relative to America] which were presented to the house by Mr. Secretary
Conway, &amp;c."
</p>
<p>
Feb. 13. Benjamin Franklin, Esq. having passed through his examination,
was exempted from farther attendance.
</p>
<p>
Feb. 24. The resolutions of the committee were reported by the chairman,
Mr. Fuller, their <em>seventh</em> and last resolution setting forth "that it was
their opinion that the house be moved, that leave be given to bring in a
bill to repeal the stamp act." A proposal for re-committing this resolution
was negatived by 240 votes to 133. (See the Journals of the House of
Commons.)
</p>
<p>
This examination of Dr. Franklin was printed in the year 1767, under
the form of a shilling pamphlet. It is prior in point of date to some of the
foregoing pieces; but I readily submitted to this derangement, thinking
by this means to provide the reader with a knowledge of the proceedings
on which the examination was grounded. B.&nbsp;V.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_84_84" id="Footnote_84_84"></a><a href="#FNanchor_84_84"><span class="label">[84]</span></a> "The stamp act says, that the Americans shall have no commerce,
make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor
grant nor recover debts; they shall neither marry nor make their wills,
unless they pay such and such sums" in <em>specie</em> for the stamps which must
give validity to the proceedings. The operation of such a tax, had it
obtained the consent of the people, appeared inevitable; and its annual
productiveness, if I recollect well, was estimated by its proposer in the
house of commons at the committee for supplies, at 100,000<em>l.</em> sterling.
The colonies being already reduced to the necessity of having <em>paper</em>-money,
by sending to Britain the specie they collected in foreign trade, in
order to make up for the deficiency of their other returns for Britain's manufactures;
there were doubts where could remain the <em>specie</em> sufficient to
answer the tax. B.&nbsp;V.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_85_85" id="Footnote_85_85"></a><a href="#FNanchor_85_85"><span class="label">[85]</span></a> The stamp act provides that a double duty should be laid "where
the instrument, proceedings, &amp;c. shall be engrossed, written, or printed,
within the said colonies and plantations, in any other than the English language."
This measure, I presume, appeared to be suggested by motives
of convenience, and the policy of assimilating persons of foreign to those
of British descent, and preventing their interference in the conduct of law
business till this change should be effected. It seems however to have
been deemed too precipitate, immediately to extend this clause to newly-conquered
countries. An exemption therefore was granted, in this particular,
with respect to Canada and Grenada, for the space of five years, to
be reckoned from the commencement of the duty. (See the Stamp Act.)

<p><a name="Footnote_86_86" id="Footnote_86_86"></a><a href="#FNanchor_86_86"><span class="label">[86]</span></a> Strangers excluded, some parts of the northern colonies double their
numbers in fifteen or sixteen years; to the southward they are longer,
but, taking one with another, they have doubled by natural generation
only, once in twenty-five years. Pensylvania, I believe, <em>including strangers</em>,
has doubled in about sixteen years. The calculation for February
1766 will not then suit 1779. B.&nbsp;V.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_87_87" id="Footnote_87_87"></a><a href="#FNanchor_87_87"><span class="label">[87]</span></a> In the year 1733&mdash;"for the welfare and prosperity of our sugar colonies
in America," and "for remedying discouragements of planters;" duties
were "<em>given and granted</em>" to George the Second upon all rum, spirits,
molasses, syrups, sugar, and paneles of foreign growth, produce, and manufacture,
imported into our colonies. This <em>regulation of trade</em>, for the
benefit of the general empire was acquiesced in, notwithstanding the introduction
of the novel terms "give and grant." But the act, which was
made only for the term of five years, and had been several times renewed
in the reign of George the Second, and once in the reign of George the
Third; was renewed again in the year 1763, in the reign of George the
Third, and <em>extended to other articles, upon new and altered grounds</em>. It
was stated in the preamble to this act, "that it was expedient that new
provisions and regulations should be established for <em>improving the revenue

<p><a name="Footnote_95_95" id="Footnote_95_95"></a><a href="#FNanchor_95_95"><span class="label">[95]</span></a> I take the following to be the history of this transaction.
</p>
<p>
Until 1763, and the years following, whenever Great Britain wanted
supplies directly from the colonies, the secretary of state, in his majesty's
name, sent them a letter of requisition, in which the occasion for the supplies
was expressed; and the colonies returned a <em>free gift</em>, the mode of
levying which <em>they</em> wholly prescribed. At this period, a chancellor of the
exchequer (Mr. George Grenville) steps forth and says to the house of
commons: <em>We must call for money from the colonies in the way of a tax</em>;&mdash;and
to the colony-agents, <em>write to your several colonies, and tell them, if
they dislike a duty upon stamps, and prefer any other method of raising the
money themselves, I shall be content, provided the</em> amount <em>be but raised</em>.
"That is," observed the colonies, when commenting upon his terms, "if
we will not tax ourselves, <em>as we may be directed</em>, the parliament will tax
us," Dr. Franklin's instructions, spoken of above, related to this gracious
option. As the colonies could not choose "<em>another</em> tax," while they disclaimed
<em>every</em> tax; the parliament passed the stamp-act.
</p>
<p>
It seems that the only part of the offer which bore a show of favour, was
the grant of the <em>mode of levying</em>&mdash;and this was the only circumstance which
was <em>not new</em>.
</p>
<p>
See Mr. Mauduit's account of Mr. Grenville's conference with the
agents, confirmed by the agents for Georgia and Virginia, and Mr.
Burke's speech, in 1774, p. 55. B.&nbsp;V.</p></div></div>

<p class="right padr2"><em>London, Nov. 28, 1768.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I received your obliging favour of the 12th instant.
Your sentiments of the importance of the present
dispute between Great Britain and the colonies,
appear to me extremely just. There is nothing I wish
for more than to see it amicably and equitably settled.</p>

<p>But Providence will bring about its own ends by its
own means; and if it intends the downfal of a nation,
that nation will be so blinded by its pride, and other
passions, as not to see its danger, or how its fall may
be prevented.</p>

<p>Being born and bred in one of the countries, and
having lived long and made many agreeable connexions
of friendship in the other, I wish all prosperity to both:
but I have talked, and written so much and so long on
the subject, that my acquaintance are weary of hearing,
and the public of reading any more of it, which begins
to make me weary of talking and writing; especially as
I do not find that I have gained any point, in either
country, except that of rendering myself suspected, by
my impartiality; in England, of being too much an
American, and in America of being too much an Englishman.
Your opinion, however, weighs with me, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
encourages me to try one effort more, in a full, though
concise state of facts, accompanied with arguments
drawn from those facts; to be published about the
meeting of parliament, after the holidays.</p>

<p>If any good may be done I shall rejoice; but at present
I almost despair.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen the barometer so low as of late?</p>

fine and fair.</p>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Nov. 21, 1769.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>In the many conversations we have had together
about our present disputes with North America, we perfectly
agreed in wishing they may be brought to a
speedy and happy conclusion. How this is to be done,
is not so easily ascertained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>
<p><em>Two objects</em>, I humbly apprehend, his majesty's servants
have now in contemplation. 1st. To relieve the
colonies from the taxes complained of, which they certainly
had no hand in imposing. 2dly, To preserve
the honour, the dignity, and the supremacy of the British
legislature over all his majesty's dominions.</p>

<p>As I know your singular knowledge of the subject in
question, and am as fully convinced of your cordial attachment
to his majesty, and your sincere desire to promote
the happiness equally of all his subjects, I beg
you would in your own clear, brief, and explicit manner,
send me an answer to the following questions: I
make this request now, because this matter is of the
utmost importance, and must very quickly be agitated.
And I do it with the more freedom, as you know me
and my motives too well to entertain the most remote
suspicion that I will make an improper use of any information
you shall hereby convey to me.</p>

<p>1st. Will not a repeal of all the duties (that on tea
excepted, which was before paid here on exportation,
and of course no new imposition) fully satisfy the colonists<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>?
If you answer in the negative,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>
<p>2d. Your reasons for that opinion?</p>

<p>3d. Do you think the only effectual way of composing
the present differences is to put the Americans
precisely in the situation they were in before the passing
of the late stamp-act?&mdash;If that is your opinion,</p>

<p>4th. Your reasons for that opinion?</p>

<p>5th. If this last method is deemed by the legislature,
and his majesty's ministers, to be repugnant to their
duty, as guardians of the just rights of the crown and
of their fellow-subjects; can you suggest any other way
of terminating these disputes, consistent with the ideas of
justice and propriety conceived by the king's subjects on
both sides of the Atlantic?</p>

<p>6. And if this method was actually followed, do you
not think it would actually encourage the violent and
factious part of the colonists to aim at still farther concessions
from the mother-country?</p>

<p>7th. If they are relieved in part only, what do you,
as a reasonable and dispassionate man, and an equal
friend to both sides, imagine will be the probable consequences?</p>

<p>The answers to these questions, I humbly conceive,
will include all the information I want; and I beg you
will favour me with them as soon as may be. Every
well-wisher to the peace and prosperity of the British
empire, and every friend to our truly happy constitution,
must be desirous of seeing even the most trivial
causes of dissention among our fellow-subjects removed.
Our domestic squabbles, in my mind, are nothing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
what I am speaking of. This you know much better
than I do, and therefore I need add nothing farther to
recommend this subject to your serious consideration.
I am, with the most cordial esteem and attachment,
dear sir, your faithful and affectionate humble servant,</p>

America, glass, red-lead, white-lead, painters' colours, paper, and <em>tea</em>
(which last article was subject to various <em>home</em>-impositions) became charged
by act of parliament, with new <em>permanent</em> duties payable in the American
ports. Soon after, in the same sessions, (the East-India Company promising
indemnification for the experiment) a <em>temporary</em> alteration was
made with respect to the <em>home</em> customs or excise upon certain teas, in the
hope that a deduction in the nominal imposition, by producing a more extended
consumption, would give an increased sum to the exchequer. Mr.
Strahan, comparing only the <em>amounts</em> of the imposed American duty, and
the deducted home duty, determines that the Americans had suffered no
new imposition. The Americans it seems, thought otherwise. Had we
established this precedent for a revenue, we thought we had every thing to
hope; yet we affect surprise, when the colonies avoided an acquiescence
which by parity of reasoning gave <em>them</em> every thing to fear. B.&nbsp;V.</p></div></div>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Answer to the preceding Queries.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Craven Street, Nov. 29, 1769.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Being just returned to town from a little excursion,
I find yours of the 21st, containing a number of
queries, that would require a pamphlet to answer them
fully. You, however, desire only brief answers, which
I shall endeavour to give.</p>

<p>Previous to your queries, you tell me, that "you apprehend
his majesty's servants have now in contemplation,
1st, To relieve the colonists from the taxes complained
of; 2d, To preserve the honour, the dignity,
and the supremacy of the British legislature over all his
majesty's dominions." I hope your information is
good; and that what you suppose to be in contemplation
will be carried into execution, by repealing all the
laws, that have been made for raising a revenue in America
by authority of parliament without the consent of
the people there. The honour and dignity of the British
legislature will not be hurt by such an act of justice
and wisdom. The wisest councils are liable to
be misled, especially in matters remote from their
inspection. It is the persisting in an error, not
the correcting it, that lessens the honour of any man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
or body of men. The supremacy of that legislature, I
believe, will be best preserved by making a very sparing
use of it; never but for the evident good of the colonies
themselves, or of the whole British empire; never
for the partial advantage of Britain to their prejudice.
By such prudent conduct, I imagine, that supremacy
may be gradually strengthened, and in time fully established;
but otherwise, I apprehend it will be disputed,
and lost in the dispute. At present the colonies consent
and submit to it, for the regulations of general
commerce; but a submission to acts of parliament was
no part of their original constitution. Our former kings
governed their colonies, as they had governed their dominions
in France, without the participation of British
parliaments. The parliament of England never presumed
to interfere in that prerogative, till the time of
the great rebellion, when they usurped the government
of all the king's other dominions, Ireland, Scotland, &amp;c.
The colonies that held for the king, they conquered by
force of arms, and governed afterwards as conquered
countries; but New England, having not opposed the
parliament, was considered and treated as a sister-kingdom,
in amity with England (as appears by the Journals,
<em>March 10, 1642</em>.)</p>

<p>1st. "Will not a repeal of all the duties (that on tea
excepted, which was before paid here on exportation,
and of course no new imposition) fully satisfy the colonists?"</p>

<p><em>Answer</em>, I think not.</p>

<p>2d. "Your reasons for that opinion?"</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Because it is not the sum paid in that duty on tea
that is complained of as a burden, but the principle of
the act, expressed in the preamble, viz. That those duties
were laid for the better support of government, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the administration of justice in the colonies<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>. This
the colonists think unnecessary, unjust, and dangerous
to their most important rights. <em>Unnecessary</em>, because
in all the colonies (two or three new ones excepted<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>)
government and the administration of justice were, and
always had been, well supported without any charge to
Britain: <em>unjust</em>, as it has made such colonies liable to
pay such charge for others, in which they had no concern
or interest: <em>dangerous</em>, as such mode of raising
money for those purposes tended to render their assemblies
useless; for if a revenue could be raised in the colonies
for all the purposes of government by act of parliament,
without grants from the people there, governors,
who do not generally love assemblies, would never
call them; they would be laid aside; and when nothing
should depend on the people's good-will to government,
their rights would be trampled on; they
would be treated with contempt. Another reason, why
I think they would not be satisfied with such a partial
repeal, is that their agreements, not to import till the
repeal takes place, include the whole; which shows, that
they object to the whole; and those agreements will
continue binding on them, if the whole is not repealed.</p>

<p>3d. "Do you think the only effectual way of composing
the present differences is to put the Americans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
precisely in the situation they were in before the passing
of the late stamp act?"</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I think so.</p>

<p>4th. "Your reasons for that opinion?"</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Other methods have been tried. They have been
refused or rebuked in angry letters. Their petitions have
been refused or rejected by parliament. They have been
threatened with the punishments of treason by resolves
of both houses. Their assemblies have been dissolved
and troops have been sent among them: but all these
ways have only exasperated their minds and widened
the breach. Their agreements to use no more British
manufactures have been strengthened; and these measures,
instead of composing differences, and promoting
a good correspondence, have almost annihilated your
commerce with those countries, and greatly endanger
the national peace and general welfare.</p>

<p>5th. "If this last method is deemed by the legislature,
and his majesty's ministers, to be repugnant to their
duty as guardians of the just rights of the crown, and
of their fellow-subjects; can you suggest any other way
of terminating these disputes, consistent with the ideas
of justice and propriety conceived by the king's subjects
on <em>both</em> sides the Atlantic?"</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I do not see how that method can be deemed repugnant
to the rights of the crown. If the Americans
are put into their former situation, it must be an act of
parliament; in the passing of which by the king, the
rights of the crown are exercised, not infringed. It is
indifferent to the crown, whether the aids received from
America are granted by parliament here, or by the assemblies
there, provided the quantum be the same; and
it is my opinion, that more will be generally granted
there voluntarily, than can ever be exacted or collected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
from thence by authority of parliament. As to the
rights of fellow-subjects (I suppose you mean the people
of Britain) I cannot conceive how those will be infringed
by that method. They will still enjoy the right
of granting their own money, and may still, if it pleases
them, keep up their claim to the right of granting ours;
a right they can never exercise properly, for want of a
sufficient knowledge of us, our circumstances and abilities
(to say nothing of the little likelihood there is that
we should ever submit to it) therefore a right that can
be of no good use to them; and we shall continue to
enjoy in fact the right of granting our money, with the
opinion, now universally prevailing among us, that we
are free subjects of the king, and that fellow-subjects of
one part of his dominions are not sovereigns over fellow-subjects
in any other part. If the subjects on the
different sides of the Atlantic have different and opposite
ideas of "justice and propriety," no one "method"
can possibly be consistent with both. The best will be,
to let each enjoy their own opinions, without disturbing
them, when they do not interfere with the common
good.</p>

<p>6th. "And if this method were actually allowed, do
you not think it would encourage the violent and factious
part of the colonists, to aim at still farther concessions
from the mother-country?"</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I do not think it would. There may be a few
among them that deserve the name of factious and violent,
as there are in all countries; but these would have
little influence, if the great majority of sober reasonable
people were satisfied. If any colony should happen to
think, that some of your regulations of trade are inconvenient
to the general interest of the empire, or prejudicial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
to them without being beneficial to you, they
will state these matters to parliament in petitions as
heretofore; but will, I believe, take no violent steps to
obtain what they may hope for in time from the wisdom
of government here. I know of nothing else they
can have in view: the notion that prevails here, of
their being desirous to set up a kingdom or commonwealth
of their own, is to my certain knowledge entirely
groundless. I therefore think, that on a total repeal
of all duties, laid expressly for the purpose of raising
a revenue on the people of America without their
consent, the present uneasiness would subside; the
agreements not to import would be dissolved; and the
commerce flourish as heretofore; and I am confirmed
in this sentiment by all the letters I have received from
America, and by the opinions of all the sensible people
who have lately come from thence, crown-officers excepted.
I know, indeed, that the people of Boston are
grievously offended by the quartering of troops among
them, as they think, contrary to law, and are very
angry with the board of commissioners, who have calumniated
them to government; but as I suppose the
withdrawing of those troops may be a consequence of
reconciliating measures taking place; and that the commission
also will be either dissolved, if found useless, or
filled with more temperate and prudent men, if still
deemed useful and necessary; I do not imagine these
particulars would prevent a return of the harmony so
much to be wished<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>
<p>7th. "If they are relieved in part only, what do you,
as a reasonable and dispassionate man, and an equal
friend to both sides, imagine will be the probable consequence?"</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I imagine, that repealing the offensive duties in
part will answer no end to this country; the commerce
will remain obstructed, and the Americans go on with
their schemes of frugality, industry, and manufactures,
to their own great advantage. How much that may
tend to the prejudice of Britain, I cannot say; perhaps
not so much as some apprehend, since she may in time
find new markets. But I think, if the union of the two
countries continues to subsist, it will not hurt the general
interest; for whatever wealth Britain loses by the
failing of its trade with the colonies, America will gain;
and the crown will receive equal aids from its subjects
upon the whole, if not greater.</p>

<p>And now I have answered your questions, as to what
may be, in my opinion, the consequences of this or
that supposed measure, I will go a little further, and
tell you, what I fear is more likely to come to pass in
<em>reality</em>. I apprehend, that the ministry, at least the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
American part of it, being fully persuaded of the right
of parliament, think it ought to be enforced, whatever
may be the consequences; and at the same time do
not believe, there is even now any abatement of the
trade between the two countries on account of these
disputes; or that if there is, it is small, and cannot
long continue. They are assured by the crown-officers
in America, that manufactures are impossible there;
that the discontented are few, and persons of little
consequence; that almost all the people of property
and importance are satisfied, and disposed to submit
quietly to the taxing power of parliament; and that, if
the revenue-acts are continued, and those duties only
that are called anti-commercial be repealed, and others
perhaps laid in their stead, the power ere long will be
patiently submitted to, and the agreements not to import
be broken, when they are found to produce no
change of measures here. From these and similar
misinformations, which seem to be credited, I think it
likely, that no thorough redress of grievances will be
afforded to America this session. This may inflame
matters still more in that country; farther rash measures
there may create more resentment here, that
may produce not merely ill-advised dissolutions of their
assemblies, as last year, but attempts to dissolve their
constitution<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>; more troops may be sent over, which
will create more uneasiness; to justify the measures of
government, your writers will revile the Americans in
your newspapers, as they have already begun to do,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
treating them as miscreants, rogues, dastards, rebels,
&amp;c. to alienate the minds of the people here from them,
and which will tend farther to diminish their affections
to this country. Possibly too, some of their warm
patriots may be distracted enough to expose themselves
by some mad action to be sent for hither, and government
here be indiscreet enough to hang them, on the
act of Henry VIII<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>. Mutual provocations will thus go
on to complete the separation; and instead of that
cordial affection, that once and so long existed, and
that harmony, so suitable to the circumstances, and so
necessary to the happiness, strength, safety, and welfare
of both countries, an implacable malice and
mutual hatred, such as we now see subsisting between
the Spaniards and Portuguese, the Genoese and Corsicans,
from the same original misconduct in the superior
governments, will take place: the sameness of nation,
the similarity of religion, manners, and language not
in the least preventing in our case, more than it did in
theirs.&mdash;I hope, however, that this may all prove false
prophecy, and that you and I may live to see as sincere
and perfect a friendship established between our respective
countries, as has so many years subsisted between
Mr. Strahan, and his truly affectionate old
friend,</p>

<p class="center xs">[PRINCIPLES.]</p>

<p>1. Wherever any Englishmen go forth without
the realm, and make settlements in partibus exteris,
"These settlements as English settlements, and these
inhabitants as English subjects (carrying with them
the laws of the land wherever they form colonies, and
receiving his majesty's protection by virtue of his royal
charter<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>" or commissions of government) "have and
enjoy all liberties and immunities of free and natural
subjects, to all intents constructions and purposes whatsoever,
as if they and every of them were born within
the realm<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>;" and are bound by the like allegiance as
every other subject of the realm.</p>

<p>Remarks. <em>The settlers of colonies in America did not
carry with them the</em> laws of the land, <em>as being bound by
them wherever they should settle. They left the realm to
avoid the inconveniences and hardships they were under,
where some of those laws were in force, particularly ecclesiastical
laws, those for payment of tythes and others.
Had it been understood, that they were to carry these laws
with them, they had better have staid at home among their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
friends, unexposed to the risques and toils of a new settlement.
They carried with them, a right to</em> such parts <em>of
the</em> laws of the land, <em>as they should judge advantageous
or useful to them; a right to be free from those they
thought hurtful; and a right to make such others, as they
should think necessary, not infringing the general rights
of Englishmen: and such</em> new <em>laws they were to form, as
agreeable as might be to the laws of England</em>. B. F.</p>

<p>2. Therefore the <em>common law of England</em>, and all
<em>such statutes</em> as were enacted and in force at <em>the time</em> in
which such settlers went forth, and such colonies and
plantations were established, (except as hereafter excepted)
together with all such alterations and amendments
as the said common law may have received, is
from time to time, and at all times, the law of those
colonies and plantations.</p>

<p>Rem. <em>So far as they adopt it, by express laws or by
practice.</em> B. F.</p>

<p>3. Therefore all statutes, touching the <em>right of the
succession</em>, and settlement of the crown, with the statutes
of treason relating thereto<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>; all statutes, <em>regulating</em> or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
limiting the general powers and <em>authority of the crown</em>,
and the exercise of the jurisdiction thereof; all statutes,
<em>declaratory of the rights and liberty of the subject</em>, do
extend to all British subjects in the colonies and plantations
as of common right, and as if they and every of
them were born within the realm.</p>

<p>Rem. <em>It is doubted, whether any settlement of the crown
by parliament, takes place in the colonies, otherwise than
by consent of the assemblies there. Had the rebellion in
1745 succeeded so far as to settle the Stuart family again
on the throne, by act of parliament, I think the colonies
would not have thought themselves bound by such act.
They would still have adhered to the present family as long
as they could.</em> B. F.</p>

<p>Observation in reply. <em>They are bound to the king and
his successors, and we know no succession but by act of
parliament.</em> T. P.</p>

<p>4. All statutes enacted <em>since</em> the establishment of
colonies and plantations do extend to and operate
within the said colonies and plantations, in which
statutes the same <em>are specially named</em>.</p>

<p>Rem. <em>It is doubted, whether any act of parliament
should</em> of right <em>operate in the colonies</em>: in fact <em>several of
than have and do operate</em>. B. F.</p>

<p>5. Statutes and customs, which respect only the
<em>special and local circumstances</em> of the realm, do not
extend to and operate within said colonies and plantations,
where no such special and local circumstances are
found.&mdash;(Thus the <em>ecclesiastical and canon</em> law, and all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
<em>statutes respecting tythes</em>, the laws respecting <em>courts baron
and copyholds</em>, the <em>game acts</em>, the statutes <em>respecting the
poor</em> and settlements, and all other laws and statutes,
having special reference to special and local circumstances
and establishments within the realm, do not
extend to and operate within these settlements, in
partibus exteris, where no such circumstances or establishments
exist.)</p>

<p>Rem. <em>These laws have no force in America: not merely
because local circumstances differ, but because they have
never been adopted, or brought over by acts of assembly or
by practice in the courts.</em> B. F.</p>

<p>6. No statutes made <em>since</em> the establishment of said
colonies and plantations (<em>except</em> as above described in
articles 3 and 4) do extend to and operate within said
colonies and plantations.</p>

<p>Query.&mdash;Would any statute made since the establishment
of said colonies and plantations, which statute
imported, to <em>annul</em> and abolish the powers and jurisdictions
of their respective constitutions of government,
where the same was not contrary to the laws, or
any otherwise forfeited or abated; or which statute
imported, to take away, or did take away, the rights
and privileges of the settlers, as British subjects: would
such statute, as of right, extend to and operate within
said colonies and plantations?</p>

<p>Answer. <em>No. The parliament has no such power.
The charters cannot be altered but by consent of both parties&mdash;the
king and the colonies.</em> B. F.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p class="center xs">[COROLLARIES FROM THE FOREGOING PRINCIPLES.]</p>

<p>Upon the matters of fact, right and law, as above
stated, it is, that the British subjects thus settled in
partibus exteris without the realm, so long as they are
excluded from an intire union with the realm as parts
of and within the same, have a right to have (as they
have) and to be governed by (as they are) a <em>distinct
intire civil government</em>, of the like powers, pre-eminences
and jurisdictions (conformable to the like rights, privileges,
immunities, franchises, and civil liberties) as are
to be found and are established in the British government,
respecting the British subject within the realm.</p>

<p>Rem. <em>Right.</em> B. F.</p>

<p>Hence also it is, that the <em>rights of the subject</em>, as
declared in the petition of right, that the <em>limitation of
prerogative</em> by the act for abolishing the star-chamber
and for regulating the privy-council, &amp;c. that the
habeas corpus act, the statute of frauds, the bill of
rights, do of common right extend to and are in force
within said colonies and plantations.</p>

<p>Rem. <em>Several of these rights are established by special
colony laws. If any are not yet so established, the colonies
have right to such laws: and the covenant having been
made in the charters by the king, for himself and his successors,
such laws ought to receive the royal assent</em> as of
right. B. F.</p>

<p>Hence it is, that the <em>freeholders</em> within the precincts
of these jurisdictions have (as of right they ought to
have) a <em>share in the power of making those laws</em> which
they are to be governed by, by the right which they
have of sending their representatives to act for them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
and to consent for them in all matters of legislation,
which representatives, when met in general assembly,
have, together with the crown, a right to perform and
do all the like acts respecting the matters, things and
rights within the precincts of their jurisdiction, as the
parliament hath respecting the realm and British dominions.</p>

<p>Hence also it is, that all the <em>executive offices</em> (from
the supreme civil magistrate, as locum tenens to the
king, down to that of constable and head-borough)
must of right be established with all and the like powers,
neither more nor less than as defined by the constitution
and law, as in fact they are established.</p>

<p>Hence it is, that the <em>judicial offices and courts of justice</em>,
established within the precincts of said jurisdictions,
have, as they ought of right to have, all those jurisdictions
and powers "as fully and amply to all intents and
purposes whatsoever, as the courts of king's bench,
common pleas, and exchequer, within his majesty's
kingdom of England, have, and ought to have, and are
empowered to give judgment and award execution
thereupon<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>."</p>

<p>Hence it is, that by the possession enjoyment and
exercise of his majesty's <em>great seal</em>, delivered to his
majesty's governor, there is established within the precincts
of the respective jurisdictions all the same and
like <em>powers of chancery</em> (except where by charters specially
excluded) as his majesty's chancellor within his
majesty's kingdom of England hath, and of right ought
to have, by delivery of the great seal of England.&mdash;And
hence it is, that all the like rights, privileges and powers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
follow the use, exercise and application of the great
seal of each colony and plantation within the precincts
of said jurisdiction, as doth, and ought of right to follow
the use, exercise, and application of the great seal.</p>

<p>Hence also it is, that <em>appeals in real actions</em>, "whereby
the lands, tenements, and hereditaments of British
subjects may be drawn into question and disposed of<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>,"
do not lie, as of right and by law they ought not to lie,
to the king in council.</p>

<p>Hence also it is, that there is <em>not</em> any law now in
being, whereby <em>the subject</em> within said colonies and
plantations can be <em>removed<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> from the jurisdiction to which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
he is amenable</em> in all his right, and through which his
service and allegiance must be derived to the crown,
and from which no appeal lies in criminal causes, so as
that such subject may become amenable to a jurisdiction
foreign to his natural and legal resiancy; to which
he may be thereby transported, and under which he
may be brought to trial and receive judgment, contrary
to the rights and privileges of the subject, as declared by
the spirit and intent and especially by the 16th § of
the habeas corpus act. And if the person of any subject
within the said colonies and plantations <em>should</em> be
seized or detained by any power issuing from any court,
without the jurisdiction of the colony where he then
had his legal resiancy, it would become the duty of
the courts of justice <em>within</em> such colony (it is undoubtedly
of their jurisdiction so to do) to issue the writ of
<em>habeas corpus</em><a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>
<p>Hence also it is, that in like manner as "the <em>command
and disposition of the militia, and of all forces by
sea and land</em>, and of all forts and places of strength, is,
and by the laws of England ever was, the undoubted
right of his majesty and his royal predecessors, kings
and queens of England, within all his majesty's realms
and dominions<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>," in like manner as the supreme military
power and command (so far as the constitution
knows of and will justify its establishment) is inseparably
annexed to, and forms an essential part of the
office of supreme civil magistrate, the office of king:
in like manner, in all <em>governments under the king</em>, where
the constituents are British subjects and of full and
perfect right entitled to the British laws and constitution,
the supreme military command within the precincts
of such jurisdictions must be inseparably annexed
to the office of supreme civil magistrate, (his majesty's
regent, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'vice-gerent'">vice-regent</ins>, lieutenant, or locum tenens,
in what form soever established) so that the king cannot,
by any<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> commission of regency, by any commission
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
or charter of government, separate or withdraw
the supreme command of the military from the office
of supreme civil magistrate&mdash;either by reserving this
command in his own hands, to be exercised and executed
independent of the civil power; or by granting a
distinct commission to any military commander in
chief, so to be exercised and executed; but more especially
not within such jurisdictions where such supreme
military power (so far as the constitution knows and
will justify the same) is <em>already</em> annexed and granted to
the office of supreme civil magistrate.&mdash;And hence it
is, that the king cannot erect or establish any law
martial or military command, by any commission
which may supersede and not be subject to the supreme
civil magistrate, within the respective precincts of the
civil jurisdictions of said colonies and plantations,
otherwise than in such manner as the said law martial
and military commissions are annexed or subject to the
supreme civil jurisdiction within his majesty's realms
and dominions of Great Britain and Ireland; and hence
it is, that the establishment and exercise of such commands
and commissions would be illegal<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>
<p>Rem. <em>The king has the command of all military force
in his dominions: but in every distinct state of his dominions
there should be the consent of the parliament or assembly
(the representative body) to the</em> raising and keeping
up <em>such military force. He cannot even raise troops and
quarter them in another, without the consent of that other.
He cannot</em> of right <em>bring troops raised in Ireland and
quarter them in Britain, but with the consent of the parliament
of Britain: nor carry to Ireland and quarter
there, soldiers raised in Britain, without the consent of the
Irish parliament, unless in time of war and cases of
extreme exigency.&mdash;In 1756, when the Speaker went up to
present the money-bills, he said among other things, that
"England was capable of fighting her own battles and
defending herself; and although ever attached to your
majesty's person, ever at ease under your just government,
they cannot forbear taking notice of some circumstances in
the present situation of affairs, which nothing but the confidence
in your justice could hinder from alarming their
most serious apprehensions. Subsidies to foreign princes,
when already burthened with a debt scarce to be borne,
cannot but be severely felt.</em> An army of foreign troops,
a thing unprecedented, unheard of, unknown, brought
into England, <em>cannot but alarm, &amp;c. &amp;c.</em>" (<em>See the
Speech.</em>)</p>

<p><em>N. B. These</em> foreign troops <em>were part of the king's
subjects, Hanoverians, and all in </em>his<em> service, which the
same thing as</em>**** B. F.</p>

their warrant for apprehending such pirates, &amp;c. in order to their being

<p>I see with pleasure that we think pretty much alike
on the subjects of English America. We of the colonies
have never insisted, that we ought to be exempt
from contributing to the common expences necessary
to support the prosperity of the empire. We only
assert, that having parliaments of our own, and not
having representatives in that of Great Britain, our
parliaments are the only judges of what we can and
what we ought to contribute in this case; and that the
English parliament has no right to take our money
without our consent. In fact, the British empire is not
a single state; it comprehends many; and though the
parliament of Great Britain has arrogated to itself the
power of taxing the colonies, it has no more right to
do so, than it has to tax Hanover. We have the same
king, but not the same legislatures.</p>

<p>The dispute between the two countries has already
cost England many millions sterling, which it has lost
in its commerce, and America has in this respect been
a proportionable gainer. This commerce consisted
principally of superfluities; objects of luxury and
fashion, which we can well do without; and the resolution
we have formed, of importing no more till our
grievances are redressed, has enabled many of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
infant manufactures to take root; and it will not be
easy to make our people abandon them in future, even
should a connection more cordial than ever succeed the
present troubles. I have indeed no doubt, that the
parliament of England will finally abandon its present
pretensions, and leave us to the peaceable enjoyment
of our rights and privileges.</p>

<p>We have long wondered here at the supineness of
the English nation, under the Prussian impositions
upon its trade entering our port. We did not, till
lately, know the claims, ancient and modern, that hang
over that nation, and therefore could not suspect, that
it might submit to those impositions from a sense of
duty, or from principles of equity. The following
edict, just made public, may, if serious, throw some
light upon this matter:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap lsp2">Frederick</span>, by the grace of God, king of Prussia
&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. to all present and to come,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> health.
The peace now enjoyed throughout our dominions,
having afforded us leisure to apply ourselves to the
regulation of commerce, the improvement of our
finances, and at the same time the easing our <em>domestic</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
subjects in their taxes: for these causes, and other
good considerations us thereunto moving, we hereby
make known, that, after having deliberated these affairs
in our council, present our dear brothers, and other
great officers of the state, members of the same; we,
of our certain knowledge, full power, and authority
royal, have made and issued this present edict, viz.</p>

<p>"Whereas it is well known to all the world, that the
first German settlements made in the island of Britain,
were by colonies of people, subjects to our renowned
ducal ancestors, and drawn from their dominions, under
the conduct of Hengist, Horsa, Hella, Uffa, Cerdicus,
Ida, and others; and that the said colonies have
flourished under the protection of our august house, for
ages past, have never been emancipated therefrom, and
yet have hitherto yielded little profit to the same: and
whereas we ourself have in the last war fought for and
defended the said colonies, against the power of France,
and thereby enabled them to make conquests from the
said power in America, for which we have not yet
received adequate compensation: and whereas it is just
and expedient that a revenue should be raised from the
said colonies in Britain towards our indemnification;
and that those who are descendants of our ancient subjects,
and thence still owe us due obedience, should
contribute to the replenishing of our royal coffers: (as
they must have done, had their ancestors remained in
the territories now to us appertaining) we do therefore
hereby ordain and command, that, from and after the
date of these presents, there shall be levied and paid to
our officers of the <em>customs</em>, on all goods, wares, and
merchandizes, and on all grain and other produce of
the earth, exported from the said island of Britain, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
on all goods of whatever kind imported into the same,
a duty of four and a half per cent <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad valorem</span>, for the
use of us and our successors.&mdash;And that the said duty
may more effectually be collected, we do hereby ordain,
that all ships or vessels bound from Great Britain to
any other part of the world, or from any other part of the
world to Great Britain, shall in their respective voyages
touch at our port of Koningsberg, there to be unladen,
searched, and charged with the said duties.</p>

<p>"And whereas there hath been from time to time
discovered in the said island of Great Britain, by our
colonists there, many mines or beds of <em>iron</em>-stone; and
sundry subjects of our ancient dominion, skilful in converting
the said stone into metal, have in time past
transported themselves thither, carrying with them and
communicating that art; and the inhabitants of the
said island, presuming that they had a natural right to
make the best use they could of the natural productions
of their country, for their own benefit, have not only
built furnaces for smelting the said stone into iron, but
have erected plating-forges, slitting-mills, and steel-furnaces,
for the more convenient manufacturing of the
same, thereby endangering a diminution of the said
manufacture in our ancient dominion; we do therefore
hereby farther ordain, that, from and after the date
hereof, no mill or other engine for slitting or rolling of
iron, or any plating-forge to work with a tilt-hammer,
or any furnace for making steel, shall be erected or
continued in the said island of Great Britain: and the
lord lieutenant of every county in the said island is
hereby commanded, on information of any such erection
within his county, to order, and by force to cause
the same to be abated and destroyed, as he shall answer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
the neglect thereof to us at his peril. But we are nevertheless
graciously pleased to permit the inhabitants
of the said island to transport their iron into Prussia,
there to be manufactured, and to them returned, they
paying our Prussian subjects for the workmanship, with
all the costs of commission, freight, and risk, coming
and returning; any thing herein contained to the contrary
notwithstanding.</p>

<p>"We do not, however, think fit to extend this our
indulgence to the article of <em>wool</em>; but meaning to encourage
not only the manufacturing of woollen cloth,
but also the raising of wool in our ancient dominions,
and to prevent both, as much as may be, in our said
island, we do hereby absolutely forbid the transportation
of wool from thence even to the mother-country,
Prussia: and that those islanders may be farther and
more effectually restrained in making any advantage of
their own wool, in the way of manufacture, we command,
that none shall be carried out of one country
into another; nor shall any worsted, bay, or woollen-yarn,
cloth, says, bays, kerseys, serges, frizes, druggets,
cloth-serges, shalloons, or any other drapery stuffs or
woollen manufactures whatsoever, made up or mixed
with wool in any of the said counties, be carried into
any other county, or be water-borne even across the
smallest river or creek, on penalty of forfeiture of the
same, together, with the boats, carriages, horses, &amp;c.
that shall be employed in removing them.&mdash;Nevertheless,
our loving subjects there are hereby permitted (if
they think proper) to use all their wool as manure, for
the improvement of their lands.</p>

<p>"And whereas the art and mystery of making <em>hats</em>
hath arrived at great perfection in Prussia, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
making of hats by our remoter subjects ought to be as
much as possible restrained: and forasmuch as the
islanders before mentioned, being in possession of wool,
beaver, and other furs, have presumptuously conceived
they had a right to make some advantage thereof, by
manufacturing the same into hats, to the prejudice of
our domestic manufacture: we do therefore hereby
strictly command and ordain, that no hats or felts
whatsoever, dyed or undyed, finished or unfinished,
shall be loaden or put into or upon any vessel, cart,
carriage, or horse, to be transported or conveyed out of
one county in the said island into another county, or to
any other place whatsoever, by any person or persons
whatsoever, on pain of forfeiting the same, with a
penalty of five hundred pounds sterling for every offence.
Nor shall any hat-maker in any of the said
counties employ more than two apprentices, on penalty
of five pounds sterling per month: we intending hereby
that such hat-makers, being so restrained, both in the
production and sale of their commodity, may find no
advantage in continuing their business. But, lest the
said islanders should suffer inconveniency by the want
of hats, we are farther graciously pleased to permit
them to send their beaver furs to Prussia, and we also
permit hats made thereof to be exported from Prussia
to Britain; the people thus favored to pay all costs
and charges of manufacturing, interest, commission to
our merchants, insurance and freight going and returning,
as in the case of iron.</p>

<p>"And lastly, being willing farther to favour our said
colonies in Britain, we do hereby also ordain and command,
that all the <em>thieves</em>, highway and street robbers,
housebreakers, forgerers, murderers, s&mdash;d&mdash;tes, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'adn villains'">and villains</ins>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
of every denomination, who have forfeited their
lives to the law in Prussia, but whom we, in our great
clemency, do not think fit here to hang, shall be emptied
out of our gaols into the said island of Great Britain,
for the better peopling of that country.</p>

<p>"We flatter ourselves, that these our royal regulations
and commands will be thought <em>just and reasonable</em>
by our much-favoured colonists in England; the said
regulations being copied from their statutes of 10 and
11 Will. III. c. 10.&mdash;5 Geo. II. c. 22.&mdash;23 Geo. II. c.
29.&mdash;4 Geo. I. c. 11. and from other equitable laws
made by their parliaments, or from instructions given
by their princes, or from resolutions of both houses,
entered into for the good government of their <em>own colonies
in Ireland and America</em>.</p>

<p>"And all persons in the said island are hereby
cautioned, not to oppose in any wise the execution of
this our edict, or any part thereof, such opposition
being high-treason; of which all who are suspected
shall be transported in fetters from Britain to Prussia,
there to be tried and executed according to the Prussian
law.</p>

<p class="right padr2">"Such is our pleasure.</p>

<p class="pad4 noindent">"Given at Potsdam, this twenty-fifth day of the
month of August, one thousand seven hundred
and seventy-three, and in the thirty-third year of

<p>Some take this edict to be merely one of the king's
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeux d'esprit</i>: others suppose it serious, and that he
means a quarrel with England: but all here think the
assertion it concludes with, "that these regulations are
copied from acts of the English parliament respecting
their colonies," a very injurious one; it being impossible
to believe, that a people distinguished for their love
of liberty; a nation so wise, so liberal in its sentiments,
so just and equitable towards its neighbours, should,
from mean and injudicious views of petty immediate
profit, treat its own children in a manner so arbitrary
and tyrannical!</p>

<p>All accounts of the discontent, so general in our colonies,
have of late years been industriously smothered
and concealed here, it seeming to suit the views of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
American minister<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> to have it understood, that by his
great abilities, all faction was subdued, all opposition
suppressed, and the whole country quieted. That the
true state of affairs there may be known, and the true
causes of that discontent well understood, the following
piece (not the production of a private writer, but the
unanimous act of a large American city) lately printed
in New England, is republished here. This nation, and
the other nations of Europe, may thereby learn, with
more certainty, the grounds of a dissention, that possibly
may, sooner or later, have consequences interesting
to them all.</p>

<p>The colonies had, from their first settlement, been
governed with more ease than perhaps can be equalled
by any instance in history of dominions so distant.
Their affection and respect for this country, while they
were treated with kindness, produced an almost implicit
obedience to the instructions of the prince, and even to
acts of the British parliament, though the right of binding
them by a legislature, in which they were unrepresented,
was never clearly understood. That respect and
affection produced a partiality in favour of every thing
that was English; whence their preference of English
modes and manufactures; their submission to restraints
on the importation of foreign goods, which they had
but little desire to use; and the monopoly we so long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
enjoyed of their commerce, to the great enriching of
our merchants and artificers. The mistaken policy of
the stamp act first disturbed this happy situation; but
the flame thereby raised was soon extinguished by its
repeal, and the old harmony restored, with all its concomitant
advantage to our commerce. The subsequent
act of another administration, which, not content with
an established exclusion of foreign manufactures, began
to make our own merchandize dearer to the consumers
there by heavy duties, revived it again; and combinations
were entered into throughout the continent, to
stop trading with Britain till those duties should be repealed.
All were accordingly repealed but one&mdash;<em>the
duty on tea</em>. This was reserved (professedly so) as a
standing claim and exercise of the right, assumed by
parliament, of laying such duties<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>. The colonies, on
this repeal, retracted their agreement, so far as related
to all other goods, except that on which the duty was
retained. This was trumpeted here by the minister for
the colonies as a triumph; there it was considered only
as a decent and equitable measure, showing a willingness
to meet the mother-country in every advance towards
a reconciliation; and this disposition to a good
understanding was so prevalent, that possibly they
might soon have relaxed in the article of tea also. But
the system of commissioners of customs, officers without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
end, with fleets and armies for collecting and enforcing
those duties, being continued; and these acting
with much indiscretion and rashness (giving great and
unnecessary trouble and obstruction to business, commencing
unjust and vexatious suits, and harassing commerce
in all its branches, while that minister kept the people
in a constant state of irritation by instructions which
appeared to have no other end than the gratifying his
private resentment<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>) occasioned a persevering adherence
to their resolutions in that particular; and the
event should be a lesson to ministers, not to risque,
through pique, the obstructing any one branch of trade;
since the course and connection of general business
may be thereby disturbed to a degree, impossible to be
foreseen or imagined. For it appears, that the colonies,
finding their humble petitions to have this duty repealed
were rejected and treated with contempt, and
that the produce of the duty was applied to the rewarding,
with undeserved salaries and pensions, every one of
their enemies; the duty itself became more odious, and
their resolution to starve it more vigorous and obstinate.
The Dutch, the Danes, and French, took this
opportunity, thus offered them by our imprudence, and
began to smuggle their teas into the plantations. At
first this was something difficult; but at length, as all
business is improved by practice, it became easy. A
coast fifteen hundred miles in length could not in all
parts be guarded, even by the whole navy of England;
especially where their restraining authority was by all
the inhabitants deemed unconstitutional, the smuggling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
of course considered as patriotism. The needy
wretches too, who, with small salaries, were trusted to
watch the ports day and night, in all weathers, found it
easier and more profitable, not only to wink, but to
sleep in their beds; the merchants' pay being more generous
than the king's. Other India goods also, which,
by themselves, would not have made a smuggling voyage
sufficiently profitable, accompanied tea to advantage;
and it is feared the cheap French silks, formerly
rejected as not to the taste of the colonies, may have
found their way with the wares of India, and now established
themselves in the popular use and opinion.</p>

<p>It is supposed, that at least a million of Americans
drink tea twice a day, which, at the first cost here, can
scarce be reckoned at less than half-a-guinea a head
per annum. This market, that, in the five years which
have run on since the act passed, would have paid
2,500,000 guineas for tea alone into the coffers of the
company, we have wantonly lost to foreigners. Meanwhile
it is said the duties have so diminished, that the
whole remittance of the last year amounted to no more
than the pitiful sum of 85<em>l.</em><a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> for the expence of some
hundred thousands, in armed ships and soldiers to support
the officers. Hence the tea, and other India goods,
which might have been sold in America, remain rotting
in the company's warehouses<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>; while those of foreign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
ports are known to be cleared by the American demand.
Hence, in some degree, the company's inability
to pay their bills; the sinking of their stock, by which
millions of property have been annihilated; the lowering
of their dividend, whereby so many must be distressed;
the loss to government of the stipulated 400,000<em>l.</em>
a year<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>, which must make a proportionable reduction
in our savings towards the discharge of our enormous
debt: and hence in part the severe blow suffered by
credit in general<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>, to the ruin of many families; the
stagnation of business in Spitalfields and at Manchester,
through want of vent for their goods; with other
future evils, which, as they cannot, from the numerous
and secret connections in general commerce, easily be
foreseen, can hardly be avoided.</p>

It is said, that this little piece very much irritated the ministry. It was
their determination, that the Americans should receive teas only from
Great Britain. And accordingly the East-India company sent out large
cargoes under their protection. The colonists every where refused, either
entrance, or else permission of sale, except at Boston, where, the force of
government preventing more moderate measures, certain persons in disguise
threw it into the sea.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>

<p class="smcap pad2">My Lord,</p>

<p>I have just received from the house of representatives
of the Massachusett's Bay, their address to the
king, which I now inclose, and send to your lordship,
with my humble request in their behalf, that you would
be pleased to present it to his majesty the first convenient
opportunity.</p>

<p>I have the pleasure of hearing from that province by
my late letters, that a sincere disposition prevails in the
people there to be on good terms with the mother-country;
that the assembly have declared their desire
only to be put into the situation they were in before the
stamp act: <em>They aim at no novelties</em>. And it is said,
that having lately discovered, as they think, the authors
of their grievances to be some of their own people,
their resentment against Britain is thence much
abated.</p>

<p>This good disposition of theirs (will your lordship
permit me to say) may be cultivated by a favourable
answer to this address, which I therefore hope your
goodness will endeavour to obtain.</p>

<p class="pfs120">THE PETITION.</p>

<p class="pfs70 lsp2">TO THE KING'S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY.</p>
<p class="p2" />
<p class="xs pad2">MOST GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN,</p>

<p>We your majesty's loyal subjects, the representatives
of your ancient colony of Massachusett's Bay, in general
court legally assembled, by virtue of your majesty's
writ under the hand and seal of the governor, beg leave
to lay this our humble petition before your majesty.</p>

<p>Nothing but the sense of duty we owe to our sovereign,
and the obligation we are under to consult the
peace and safety of the province, could induce us to remonstrate
to your majesty [concerning] the mal-conduct
of persons, who have heretofore had the confidence
and esteem of this people; and whom your majesty has
been pleased, from the purest motives of rendering
your subjects happy, to advance to the highest places of
trust and authority in the province.</p>

<p>Your majesty's humble petitioners, with the deepest
concern and anxiety, have seen the discords and animosities
which have too long subsisted between your
subjects of the parent-state and those of the American
colonies. And we have trembled with apprehensions,
that the consequences, naturally arising therefrom,
would at length prove fatal to both countries.</p>

<p>Permit us humbly to suggest to your majesty, that
your subjects here have been inclined to believe, that
the grievances which they have suffered, and still continue
to suffer, have been occasioned by your majesty's
ministers and principal servants being, unfortunately
for us, <em>misinformed</em> in certain facts of very interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
importance to us. It is for this reason that former assemblies
have, from time to time, prepared a true state
of facts to be laid before your majesty; but their humble
remonstrances and petitions, it is presumed, have
by some means been prevented from reaching your
royal hand.</p>

<p>Your majesty's petitioners have very lately had before
them <em>certain papers</em>, from which they humbly conceive,
it is most reasonable to suppose, that there has been
long a conspiracy of evil men in this province, who
have contemplated measures and formed a plan to advance
themselves to power, and raise their own fortunes,
by means destructive of the charter of the province,
at the expence of the quiet of the nation, and
to the annihilating of the rights and liberties of the
American colonies.</p>

<p>And we do with all due submission to your majesty
beg leave particularly to complain of the conduct of his
excellency Thomas Hutchinson, Esq. governor, and the
honourable Andrew Oliver, Esq. lieutenant-governor
of this your majesty's province, as having a natural
and efficacious tendency to interrupt and alienate the
affections of your majesty, our rightful sovereign, from
this your loyal province; to destroy that harmony and
good-will between Great Britain and this colony, which
every honest subject should strive to establish; to excite
the resentment of the British administration against
this province; to defeat the endeavours of our agents
and friends to serve us by a fair representation of our
state of facts; to prevent our humble and repeated petitions
from reaching the ear of your majesty, or having
their desired effect. And finally, that the said Thomas
Hutchinson and Andrew Oliver have been among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
chief instruments in introducing a fleet and army into
this province, to establish and perpetuate their plans,
whereby they have been not only greatly instrumental
[in] disturbing the peace and harmony of the government,
and causing unnatural and hateful discords and
animosities between the several parts of your majesty's
extensive dominions; but are justly chargeable with all
that corruption of morals, and all that confusion, misery,
and bloodshed, which have been the natural effects of
posting an army in a populous town.</p>

<p>Wherefore we most humbly pray, that your majesty
would be pleased to remove from their posts in this government
the said Thomas Hutchinson, Esquire, and
Andrew Oliver, Esquire; who have, by their above-mentioned
conduct, and otherwise, rendered themselves
justly obnoxious to your loving subjects, and entirely
lost their confidence; and place such good and faithful
men in their stead, as your majesty in your wisdom
shall think fit.</p>

Franklin's abilities, and wish to put the defence of my
friends more upon a parity with the attack; he will
not therefore wonder that I choose to appear before
your lordships with the assistance of counsel. My
friends, in their letters to me, have desired (if any proceedings,
as they say, should be had upon this address)
that they may have a hearing in their own justification,
that their innocence may be fully cleared, and their honour
vindicated, and have made provision accordingly.
I do not think myself at liberty therefore to give up
the assistance of my counsel, in defending them against
this unjust accusation.</p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>Finding that two gentlemen have been unfortunately
engaged in a duel about a transaction and its
circumstances, of which both of them are totally ignorant
and innocent, I think it incumbent upon me to
declare (for the prevention of farther mischief, as far as
such a declaration may contribute to prevent it) that I
alone am the person, who obtained and transmitted to
Boston the letters in question. Mr. W. could not
communicate them, because they were never in his
possession; and for the same reason they could not be
taken from him by Mr. T. They were not of the
nature of <em>private</em> letters between friends. They were
written by public officers to persons in public stations,
on public affairs, and intended to procure public measures;
they were therefore handed to other public
persons, who might be influenced by them to produce
those measures. Their tendency was to incense the
mother-country against her colonies, and, by the steps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
recommended, to widen the breach, which they effected.
The chief caution expressed with regard to privacy
was, to keep their contents from the colony
agents, who, the writers apprehended, might return
them, or copies of them, to America. That apprehension
was, it seems, well founded, for the first agent who
laid his hands on them thought it his duty to transmit
them to his constituents<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.</p>

Paxton, Esq. Nathaniel Rogers, Esq. and Mr. G. Roome, having sent
from Boston certain representations and informations to Thomas Whately,
Esq. member of parliament, private secretary to Mr. George Grenville
(the father of the stamp act) when in office, and afterwards one of the
lords of trade; these letters were, by a particular channel, conveyed back
to Boston. The assembly of the province were so much exasperated, that
they returned home attested copies of the letters, accompanied with a petition
and remonstrance, for the removal of governor Hutchinson, and
lieutenant-governor Andrew Oliver, from their posts. The council of the
province likewise, on their part, entered into thirteen resolves, in tendency
and import similar to the petition of the assembly; five of which resolves
were unanimous, and only one of them had so many as three dissentients.
In consequence of the assembly's petition, the above proceedings and examination
took place.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Franklin having naturally a large share in these transactions, made
still larger by the impolitic and indecent persecution of his character, I
have exhibited the whole more at length, than I should otherwise have
thought proper. B.&nbsp;V.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_128_128" id="Footnote_128_128"></a><a href="#FNanchor_128_128"><span class="label">[128]</span></a> The privy council accordingly met on the 29th of January, 1774,
when Mr. Dunning and Mr. John Lee appeared as counsel for the assembly,
and Mr. Wedderburn as counsel for the governor and lieutenant governor.
Mr. Wedderburn was very long in his answer, which chiefly
related to the mode of obtaining and sending away Mr. Whately's letters;
and spoke of Dr. Franklin in terms of abuse, which never escape from one
gentleman towards another. In the event, the committee of the privy
council made a report, in which was expressed the following opinion:
"The lords of the committee do agree humbly to report, as their opinion to
your majesty, that the petition is founded upon resolutions formed on false
and erroneous allegations; and is groundless, vexatious, and scandalous,
and calculated only for the seditious purposes of keeping up a spirit of
clamour and discontent in the said province. And the lords of the committee
do further humbly report to your majesty, that nothing has been
laid before them which does or can, in their opinion, in any manner, or in
any degree, impeach the honour, integrity, or conduct of the said governor
or lieutenant-governor; and their lordships are humbly of opinion,
that the said petition ought to be dismissed."
</p>
<p>
Feb. 7th, 1774. "His majesty, taking the said report into consideration,
was pleased, with the advice of his privy-council, to approve thereof;
and to order, that the said petition of the house of representatives of the
province of Massachusett's Bay be dismissed the board&mdash;as groundless,
vexatious, and scandalous; and calculated only for the seditious purpose
of keeping up a spirit of clamour and discontent in the said province."&mdash;A
former petition against governor Bernard met with a dismission couched
in similar terms. B.&nbsp;V.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_129_129" id="Footnote_129_129"></a><a href="#FNanchor_129_129"><span class="label">[129]</span></a> Some letters had passed in the public prints between Mr. Thomas
Whately's brother and Mr. John Temple, concerning the manner in which
the letters of Governor Hutchinson &amp;c. had escaped from among the
papers of Mr. Thomas Whately, at this time deceased.
</p>
<p>
The one gentleman wished to avoid the charge of having given them,
the other of having taken them. At length the dispute became so personal
and pointed, that Mr. Temple thought it necessary to call the brother
into the field. The letter of provocation appeared in the morning, and
the parties met in the afternoon. Dr. Franklin, was not then in town; it
was after some interval that he received the intelligence. What had
passed he could not foresee; he endeavoured to prevent what still might
follow. B.&nbsp;V.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_130_130" id="Footnote_130_130"></a><a href="#FNanchor_130_130"><span class="label">[130]</span></a>
It was in consequence of this letter that Mr. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Wedderburne'">Wedderburn</ins> ventured
to make the most odious personal applications. Mr. Mauduit has prudently
omitted part of them in his account of the proceedings before the
privy-council. They are given here altogether however (as well as they
could be collected) to mark the politics of the times, and the nature of the
censures passed in England upon Dr. Franklin's character.
</p>
<p>
"The letters could not have come to Dr. Franklin," said Mr. Wedderburn,
"by fair means. The writers did not give them to him, nor yet did
the deceased correspondent, who, from our intimacy, would otherwise have
told me of it: nothing then will acquit Dr. Franklin of the charge of obtaining
them by fraudulent or corrupt means, for the most malignant of
purposes; unless he stole them, from the person who stole them. This
argument is irrefragable."&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"I hope, my lords, you will mark [and brand] the man, for the honour
of this country, of Europe, and of mankind. Private correspondence has
hitherto been held sacred in times of the greatest party rage, not only in
politics but religion."&mdash;"He has forfeited all the respect of societies and
of men. Into what companies will he hereafter go with an unembarassed
face, or the honest intrepidity of virtue. Men will watch him with a jealous
eye, they will hide their papers from him, and lock up their escrutoires.
He will henceforth esteem it a libel to be called a <em>man of letters,
homo</em> trium<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> <em>literarum</em>!
</p>
<p>
"But he not only took away the letters from one brother, but kept
himself concealed till he nearly occasioned the murder of the other. It is
impossible to read his account, expressive of the coolest and most deliberate
malice, without horror." [<em>Here he read the letter above, Dr. Franklin
being all the time present.</em>]&mdash;Amidst these tragical events, of one person
nearly murdered, of another answerable for the issue, of a worthy governor
hurt in his dearest interests, the fate of America in suspense; here is a
man, who, with the utmost insensibility of remorse, stands up and avows
himself the author of all. I can compare it only to Zanga in Dr. Young's
<cite>Revenge</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"Know then 'twas&mdash;&mdash;I:</p>
<p class="verse">I forged the letter, I disposed the picture;</p>
<p class="verse">I hated, I despised, and I destroy.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
"I ask, my lords, whether the revengeful temper, attributed by poetic
fiction only to the bloody African, is not surpassed by the coolness and
apathy of the wily American?"
</p>
<p>
These pleadings for a time worked great effect: the lords assented, the
town was convinced, Dr. Franklin was disgraced<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>, and Mr. Wedderburn
seemed in the road for every kind of advancement.&mdash;Unfortunately for
Mr. Wedderburn, the events of the war did not correspond with his
systems. Unfortunately too for his "irrefragable argument," Dr. Franklin
afterwards took an oath in chancery<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>, that at the time that he transmitted
the letters he was ignorant of the party to whom they had been
addressed, having himself received them from a third person, and for the
express purpose of their being conveyed to America. Unfortunately also
for Mr. Wedderburn's "worthy governor," that governor himself, <em>before</em>
the arrival of Dr Franklin's packet in Boston, sent over one of Dr.
Franklin's own "private" letters to England, expressing some little coyness
indeed upon the occasion, but desiring secrecy, lest he should be prevented
procuring <em>more</em> useful intelligence from the same source<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>.
Whether Mr. Wedderburn in his speech intended to draw a particular
case and portraiture, for the purpose only of injuring Dr. Franklin, or
meant that his language and epithets should apply generally to all, whether
friends or foes, whose practice should be found similar to it, is a
matter that must be left to be adjusted between governor Hutchinson and
Mr. Wedderburn.
</p>
<p>
But to return to Dr. Franklin. It was not singular perhaps, that, as a
man of honour, he should surrender his name to public scrutiny in order to
prevent mischief to others, and yet not betray his coadjutor (even to the
present moment) to relieve his own fame from the severest obloquy; but
perhaps it belonged to few besides Dr. Franklin, to possess mildness and
magnanimity enough to refrain from intemperate expressions and measures
against Mr. Wedderburn and his supporters, after all that had passed. B.&nbsp;V.</p></div>

late Minister, when he entered upon his Administration.</em></a><a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></h3>

<p>An ancient sage valued himself upon this, that
though he could not fiddle, he knew how to make a
great city of a little one. The science, that I, a modern,
simpleton, am about to communicate, is the very reverse.</p>

<p>I address myself to all ministers, who have the management
of extensive dominions, which, from their
very greatness, are become troublesome to govern&mdash;because
the multiplicity of their affairs leaves no time for
fiddling.</p>

<p>I. In the first place, gentlemen, you are to consider,
that a great empire, like a great cake, is most easily
diminished at the edges. Turn your attention therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
first to your <em>remotest</em> provinces; that, as you get rid of
them, the next may follow in order.</p>

<p>II. That the possibility of this separation may always
exist, take special care the provinces are <em>never incorporated
with the mother-country</em>; that they do not enjoy
the same common rights, the same privileges in commerce,
and that they are governed by severer laws, all
of your enacting, without allowing them any share in
the choice of the legislators. By carefully making and
preserving such distinctions, you will (to keep to my
simile of the cake) act like a wise gingerbread-baker;
who, to facilitate a division, cuts his dough half through
in those places, where, when baked, he would have it
broken to pieces.</p>

<p>III. Those remote provinces have perhaps been acquired,
purchased, or conquered, at the sole expence of
the settlers or their ancestors, without the aid of the
mother-country. If this should happen to increase her
strength, by their growing numbers, ready to join in
her wars; her commerce, by their growing demand for
her manufactures; or her naval power, by greater employment
for her ships and seamen, they may probably
suppose some merit in this, and that it entitles them to
some favour: you are therefore to <em>forget it all, or resent
it</em>, as if they had done you injury. If they happen to
be zealous whigs, friends of liberty, nurtured in revolution
principles; remember all that to their prejudice,
and contrive to punish it: for such principles, after a
revolution is thoroughly established, are of no more
use; they are even odious and abominable.</p>

<p>IV. However peaceably your colonies have submitted
to your government, shown their affection to your
interests, and patiently borne their grievances, you are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
to suppose them <em>always inclined to revolt</em>, and treat them
accordingly. Quarter troops among them, who, by
their insolence, may provoke the rising of mobs, and
by their bullets and bayonets suppress them. By this
means, like the husband who uses his wife ill from suspicion,
you may in time convert your suspicions into realities.</p>

<p>V. Remote provinces must have governors and
judges, to represent the royal person and execute every
where the delegated parts of his office and authority.
You, ministers, know, that much of the strength of government
depends on the opinion of the people, and
much of that opinion on the <em>choice of rulers</em> placed immediately
over them. If you send them wise and good
men for governors, who study the interest of the colonists,
and advance their prosperity; they will think
their king wise and good, and that he wishes the welfare
of his subjects. If you send them learned and upright
men for judges, they will think him a lover of
justice. This may attach your provinces more to his
government. You are therefore to be careful who you
recommend for those offices.&mdash;If you can find prodigals,
who have ruined their fortunes, broken gamesters
or stock-jobbers, these may do well as governors, for
they will probably be rapacious, and provoke the people
by their extortions. Wrangling proctors and pettyfogging
lawyers too are not amiss, for they will be for
ever disputing and quarrelling with their little parliaments.
If withal they should be ignorant, wrong-headed
and insolent, so much the better. Attorneys
clerks and Newgate solicitors will do for chief justices,
especially if they hold their places during your pleasure:&mdash;and
all will contribute to impress those ideas of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
your government, that are proper for a people you
would wish to renounce it.</p>

<p>VI. To confirm these impressions, and strike them
deeper, whenever the injured come to the capital with
complaints of mal-administration, oppression, or injustice,
<em>punish such suitors</em> with long delay, enormous expence,
and a final judgment in favour of the oppressor.
This will have an admirable effect every way. The
trouble of future complaints will be prevented, and governors
and judges will be encouraged to farther acts of
oppression and injustice, and thence the people may
become more disaffected, and at length desperate.</p>

<p>VII. When such governors have crammed their
coffers, and made themselves so odious to the people,
that they can no longer remain among them with safety
to their persons, <em>recal and reward</em> them with pensions.
You may make them baronets too, if that respectable
order should not think fit to resent it. All will contribute
to encourage new governors in the same practice,
and make the supreme government detestable.</p>

<p>VIII. If, when you are engaged in war, your colonies
should vie in liberal aids of men and money against the
common enemy upon your simple requisition, and give
far beyond their abilities,&mdash;reflect, that a penny, taken
from them by your power, is more honourable to you,
than a pound presented by their benevolence; <em>despise
therefore their voluntary grants</em>, and resolve to harass
them with <em>novel taxes</em>.&mdash;They will probably complain to
your parliament, that they are taxed by a body in
which they have no representative, and that this is contrary
to common right. They will petition for redress.
Let the parliament flout their claims, reject their petitions,
refuse even to suffer the reading of them, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
treat the petitioners with the utmost contempt. Nothing
can have a better effect in producing the alienation
proposed; for though many can forgive injuries,
none ever forgave contempt.</p>

<p>IX. In laying these taxes, <em>never regard the heavy burthens</em>
those remote people already undergo, in defending
their own frontiers, supporting their own provincial
government, making new roads, building bridges,
churches, and other public edifices, which in old countries
have been done to your hands, by your ancestors,
but which occasion constant calls and demands on the
purses of a new people.&mdash;Forget the restraint you lay
on their trade for your own benefit, and the advantage
a monopoly of this trade gives your exacting merchants.
Think nothing of the wealth those merchants and your
manufacturers acquire by the colony commerce, their
increased ability thereby to pay taxes at home, their
accumulating, in the price of their commodities, most
of those taxes, and so levying them from their consuming
customers: all this, and the employment and support
of thousands of your poor by the colonists, you are
entirely to forget. But remember to make your arbitrary
tax more grievous to your provinces, by public
declarations, importing, that your power of taxing them
has <em>no limits</em>, so that when you take from them without
their consent a shilling in the pound, you have a clear
right to the other nineteen. This will probably weaken
every idea of security in their property, and convince
them, that under such a government they have nothing
they can call their own; which can scarce fail of producing
the happiest consequences!</p>

<p>X. Possibly indeed some of them might still comfort
themselves and say, "though we have no property, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
have yet something left that is valuable, we have constitutional
<em>liberty, both of person and of conscience</em>. This
king, these lords, and these commons, who it seems are
too remote from us to know us and feel for us, cannot
take from us our habeas corpus right, or our right of
trial by a jury of our neighbours: they cannot deprive
us of the exercise of our religion, alter our ecclesiastical
constitution, and compel us to be papists, if they please,
or Mahometans." To annihilate this comfort, begin
by laws to perplex their commerce with infinite regulations,
impossible to be remembered and observed: ordain
seizures of their property for every failure, take
away the trial of such property by jury, and give it to
arbitrary judges of your own appointing, and of the
lowest characters in the country, whose salaries and
emoluments are to arise out of the duties or condemnations,
and whose appointments are during pleasure.
Then let there be a formal declaration of both houses,
that opposition to your edicts is treason, and that persons
suspected of treason in the provinces may, according
to some obsolete law, be seized and sent to the
metropolis of the empire for trial; and pass an act, that
those there charged with certain other offences shall
be sent away in chains from their friends and country,
to be tried in the same manner for felony. Then erect
a new court of inquisition among them, accompanied
by an armed force, with instructions to transport all
such suspected persons, to be ruined by the expence,
if they bring over evidences to prove their innocence,
or be found guilty and hanged, if they cannot afford it.
And lest the people should think you cannot possibly
go any farther, pass another solemn declaratory act,
"that king, lords, and commons had, have, and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
right ought to have, full power and authority to make
statutes of sufficient force and validity to bind the unrepresented
provinces <em>in all cases whatsoever</em>." This
will include spiritual with temporal, and taken together
must operate wonderfully to your purpose, by convincing
them, that they are at present under a power, something
like that spoken of in the Scriptures, which can
not only kill their bodies, but damn their souls to all
eternity, by compelling them, if it pleases, to worship
the devil.</p>

<p>XI. To make your taxes more odious, and more
likely to procure resistance, send from the capital a
<em>board of officers</em> to superintend the collection, <em>composed
of the most indiscreet</em>, ill-bred, and insolent you can find.
Let these have large salaries out of the extorted revenue,
and live in open grating luxury upon the sweat
and blood of the industrious, whom they are to worry
continually with groundless and expensive prosecutions,
before the above-mentioned arbitrary revenue-judges;
all at the cost of the party prosecuted, though acquitted,
because the king is to pay no costs. Let these men, by
your order, be exempted from all the common taxes
and burthens of the province, though they and their
property are protected by its laws. If any revenue
officers are suspected of the least tenderness for the
people, discard them. If others are justly complained
of, protect and reward them. If any of the under officers
behave so as to provoke the people to drub them,
promote those to better offices: this will encourage
others to procure for themselves such profitable drubbings,
by multiplying and enlarging such provocations,
and all will work towards the end you aim at.</p>

<p>XII. Another way to make your tax odious is, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
<em>misapply the produce of it</em>. If it was originally appropriated
for the defence of the provinces, and the better
support of government, and the administration of
justice, where it may be necessary; then apply none of
it to that defence, but bestow it, where it is not necessary,
in augmenting salaries or pensions to every governor,
who has distinguished himself by his enmity to the
people, and by calumniating them to their sovereign.
This will make them pay it more unwillingly, and be
more apt to quarrel with those that collect it, and those
that imposed it, who will quarrel again with them, and
all shall contribute to your own purpose, of making
them weary of your government.</p>

<p>XIII. If the people of any province have been accustomed
to <em>support their own governors and judges</em> to
satisfaction, you are to apprehend, that such governors
and judges may be thereby influenced to treat the people
kindly, and to do them justice. This is another
reason for applying part of that revenue in larger salaries
to such governors and judges, given, as their commissions
are, during <em>your</em> pleasure only, forbidding
them to take any salaries from their provinces; that
thus the people may no longer hope any kindness from
their governors, or (in crown cases) any justice from
their judges. And as the money, thus misapplied in one
province, is extorted from all, probably all will resent
the misapplication.</p>

<p>XIV. If the parliaments of your provinces should
dare to claim rights, or complain of your administration,
order them to be harassed with <em>repeated dissolutions</em>.
If the same men are continually returned by
new elections, adjourn their meetings to some country
village, where they cannot be accommodated, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
there keep them during pleasure; for this, you know,
is your prerogative, and an excellent one it is, as you
may manage it, to promote discontents among the people,
diminish their respect, and increase their disaffection.</p>

<p>XV. Convert the brave honest officers of your <em>navy</em>
into pimping tide-waiters and colony officers of the
<em>customs</em>. Let those, who in time of war fought gallantly
in defence of the commerce of their countrymen, in
peace be taught to prey upon it. Let them learn to be
corrupted by great and real smugglers; but (to show
their diligence) scour with armed boats every bay, harbour,
river, creek, cove or nook, throughout the coast
of your colonies; stop and detain every coaster, every
wood-boat, every fisherman, tumble their cargoes and
even their ballast inside out, and upside down; and if
a pennyworth of pins is found un-entered, let the whole
be seized and confiscated. Thus shall the trade of
your colonists suffer more from their friends in time of
peace, than it did from their enemies in war. Then let
these boats' crews land upon every farm in their way,
rob their orchards, steal their pigs and poultry, and
insult the inhabitants. If the injured and exasperated
farmers, unable to procure other justice, should attack
the aggressors, drub them, and burn their boats, you
are to call this <em>high treason and rebellion</em>, order fleets
and armies into their country, and threaten to carry all
the offenders three thousand miles to be hanged,
drawn, and quartered.&mdash;O! this will work admirably!</p>

<p>XVI. If you are told of <em>discontents</em> in your colonies,
never believe that they are general, or that you have
given occasion for them; therefore do not think of applying
any remedy, or of changing any offensive measure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
Redress no grievance, lest they should be encouraged
to demand the redress of some other grievance.
Grant no request, that is just and reasonable,
lest they should make another, that is unreasonable.
Take all your informations of the state of the colonies
from your governors and officers in enmity with them.
Encourage and reward these leasing-makers, secrete
their lying accusations, lest they should be confuted,
but act upon them as the clearest evidence; and believe
nothing you hear from the friends of the people. Suppose
all <em>their</em> complaints to be invented and promoted
by a few factious demagogues, whom if you could
catch and hang, all would be quiet. Catch and hang
a few of them accordingly, and the blood of the
martyrs shall work miracles in favour of your purpose<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.</p>

<p>XVII. If you see <em>rival nations</em> rejoicing at the prospect
of your disunion with your provinces, and endeavouring
to promote it, if they translate, publish and
applaud all the complaints of your discontented colonists,
at the same time privately stimulating you to
severer measures, let not that alarm or offend you.
Why should it? since you all mean the same thing?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>
<p>XVIII. If any colony should <em>at their own charge erect
a fortress</em>, to secure their <em>port</em> against the fleets of a
foreign enemy, get your governor to betray that fortress
into your hands. Never think of paying what it cost
the country, for that would look, at least, like some regard
for justice; but turn it into a citadel, to awe the
inhabitants and curb their commerce. If they should
have lodged in such fortress the very arms they bought
and used to aid you in your conquests, seize them all;
it will provoke like ingratitude added to robbery. One
admirable effect of these operations will be, to discourage
every other colony from erecting such defences,
and so their and your enemies may more easily invade
them, to the great disgrace of your government, and of
course the furtherance of your project.</p>

<p>XIX. Send armies into their country, under pretence
of protecting the inhabitants; but, instead of garrisoning
the forts on their frontiers with those troops, to
prevent incursions, demolish those forts, and order the
troops into the heart of the country, that the savages
may be encouraged to attack the frontiers<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>, and that
the troops may be protected by the inhabitants: this
will seem to proceed from your <em>ill-will or your ignorance</em>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
and contribute farther to produce and strengthen an
opinion among them, that you are no longer fit to
govern them<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>.</p>

<p>XX. Lastly, invest the <em>general of your army in the
provinces</em> with great and unconstitutional powers, and
free him from the controul of even your own civil governors.
Let him have troops enow under his command,
with all the fortresses in his possession, and who
knows but (like some provincial generals in the Roman
empire, and encouraged by the universal discontent
you have produced) he may take it into his head to set
up for himself? If he should, and you have carefully
practised these few excellent rules of mine, take my
word for it, all the provinces will immediately join
him&mdash;and you will that day (if you have not done it
sooner) get rid of the trouble of governing them, and
all the plagues attending their commerce and connection
from thenceforth and for ever.</p>

New England (the peccant country) was held a coward or a knave, and
the disorders, which spread abroad there, were treated as the result of the
<em>too great lenity</em> of Britain! By the aid of this short and benevolent rule,

assembled chiefs of the western nations told one of our Indian agents,
"that they remembered their father, the king of Great Britain's message,
delivered to them last fall, of demolishing Fort Pittsburg (on the Ohio)
and removing the soldiers with their sharp-edged weapons out of the
country:&mdash;this gave them great pleasure, as it was a strong proof of his
paternal kindness towards them." (See Considerations on the Agreement

history: I attempt no application of facts, personally invidious. B.&nbsp;V.</p></div>

of ministry and the candor and veracity of Dr. Franklin, I shall inform
him that two contrary objections may be made to the truth of this
representation. The first is, that the conduct of Great Britain is made <em>too</em>
absurd for possibility, and the second, that it is not made absurd <em>enough</em> for
fact. If we consider that this piece does not include the measures subsequent
to 1773, the latter difficulty is easily set aside. The former I can
only solve by the many instances in history, where the infatuation of individuals
has brought the heaviest calamities upon nations. B.&nbsp;V.</p></div></div>

<p>Forasmuch as the enemies of America, in the
parliament of Great Britain, to render us odious to the
nation, and give an ill impression of us in the minds of
other European powers, have represented us as unjust
and ungrateful in the highest degree; asserting on
every occasion, that the colonies were settled at the
expence of Britain; that they were, at the expence
of the same, protected in their infancy; that they now
ungratefully and unjustly refuse to contribute to their
own protection, and the common defence of the nation;
that they aim at independence; that they intend
an abolition of the navigation acts; and that they are
fraudulent in their commercial dealings, and purpose to
cheat their creditors in Britain, by avoiding the payment
of their just debts:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>
<p>[And] as, by frequent repetition, these groundless assertions
and malicious calumnies may, if not contradicted
and refuted, obtain farther credit, and be injurious
throughout Europe to the reputation and interest
of the confederate colonies, it seems proper and necessary
to examine them in our own just vindication.</p>

<p>With regard to the first, <em>that the colonies were</em> settled
<em>at the expence of Britain</em>, it is a known fact, that none of
the twelve united colonies were settled, or even discovered,
at the expence of England. Henry the VIIth
indeed granted a commission to Sebastian Cabot, a
Venetian, and his sons, to sail into the western seas for
the discovery of new countries; but it was to be "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>suis</em>
eorum propriis sumptibus et expensis</span>," at their <em>own</em>
costs and charges<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>. They discovered, but soon slighted
and neglected, these northern territories; which
were, after more than a hundred years dereliction, purchased
of the natives, and settled at the charge and by
the labour of private men and bodies of men, our
ancestors, who came over hither for that purpose. But
our adversaries have never been able to produce any
record, that ever the <em>parliament</em> or government of England
was at the smallest expence on these accounts:
on the contrary, there exists on the journals of parliament
a solemn declaration in 1642, (only twenty-two
years after the first settlement of the Massachusetts,
when, if such expence had ever been incurred, some of
the members must have known and remembered it)
"That these colonies had been planted and established
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
<em>without any expence to the state</em>.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>" <em>New-York</em> is the
only colony in the founding of which England can pretend
to have been at any expence, and that was only
the charge of a small armament to take it from the
Dutch, who planted it. But to retain this colony at
peace, another at that time, full as valuable, planted
by private countrymen of <em>ours</em>, was given up by the
crown to the Dutch in exchange, viz. Surinam, now a
wealthy sugar-colony in Guiana, and which, but for that
cession, might still have remained in our possession.
Of late, indeed, Britain has been at some expence in
planting two colonies, <em>Georgia</em><a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> and <em>Nova Scotia</em>; but
those are not in our confederacy; and the expence she
has been at in their name, has chiefly been in grants of
sums unnecessarily large, by way of salaries to officers
sent from England, and in jobs to friends, whereby
dependants might be provided for; those excessive
grants not being requisite to the welfare and good
government of the colonies; which good government
(as experience in many instances of other colonies has
taught us) may be much more frugally, and full as effectually
provided for, and supported.</p>

<p>With regard to the second assertion, <em>that these colonies
were</em> protected <em>in their infant state by England</em>, it is
a notorious fact, that in none of the many wars with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
Indian natives, sustained by our infant settlements for
a century after our first arrival, were ever any troops or
forces of any kind sent from England to assist us; nor
were any forts built at her expence to secure our sea-ports
from foreign invaders; nor any ships of war sent
to protect our trade, till many years after our first settlement,
when our commerce became an object of
revenue, or of advantage to British merchants, and
then it was thought necessary to have a frigate in some
of our ports, during peace, to give weight to the authority
of custom-house officers, who were to restrain that
commerce for the benefit of England. Our own arms,
with our poverty, and the care of a kind providence,
were all this time our only protection, while we were
neglected by the English government; which either
thought us not worth its care, or, having no good will
to some of us, on account of our different sentiments
in religion and politics, was indifferent what became of
us. On the other hand, the colonies have not been
wanting to do what they could in every war for annoying
the enemies of Britain. They formerly assisted
her in the conquest of Nova Scotia. In the war before
last they took Louisbourg, and put it into her hands.
She made her peace with that strong fortress, by restoring
it to France, greatly to their detriment. In the last
war, it is true, Britain sent a fleet and army, who acted
with an equal army of ours, in the reduction of Canada;
and perhaps thereby did more for us, than we in the
preceding wars had done for her. Let it be remembered
however, that she rejected the plan we formed
in the congress at Albany, in 1754, for our own defence,
by an union of the colonies; an union she was
jealous of, and therefore chose to send her own forces;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
otherwise her aid to protect us was not wanted. And
from our first settlement to that time, her military
operations in our favour were small, compared with the
advantages she drew from her exclusive commerce
with us. We are however willing to give full weight
to this obligation; and as we are daily growing stronger,
and our assistance to her becomes of more importance,
we should with pleasure embrace the first opportunity
of showing our gratitude, by returning the favour
in kind. But when Britain values herself as affording
us protection, we desire it may be considered, that we
have followed <em>her</em> in all <em>her</em> wars, and joined with her at
our own expence against all she thought fit to quarrel
with. This she has required of us, and would never
permit us to keep peace with any power she declared
her enemy, though by separate treaties we might well
have done it. Under such circumstances, when, at her
instance, we made nations our enemies, whom we might
otherwise have retained our friends; we submit it to the
common sense of mankind, whether her protection of
us in these wars was not our <em>just due</em>, and to be claimed
of <em>right</em>, instead of being received as a <em>favour</em>? And
whether, when all the parts of an empire exert themselves
to the utmost in their common defence, and in
annoying the common enemy, it is not as well the
<em>parts</em> that protect the <em>whole</em>, as the <em>whole</em> that protects
the <em>parts</em>? The protection then has been proportionably
mutual. And whenever the time shall come, that
our abilities may as far exceed hers, as hers have exceeded
ours, we hope we shall be reasonable enough to
rest satisfied with her proportionable exertions, and not
think we do too much for a part of the empire, when
that part does as much as it can for the whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>
<p>The charge against us, <em>that we refuse to</em> contribute <em>to
our own protection</em>, appears from the above to be groundless:
but we farther declare it to be absolutely false;
for it is well known, that we ever held it as our duty to
grant aids to the crown, upon requisition, towards carrying
on its wars; which duty we have cheerfully complied
with, to the utmost of our abilities; insomuch that
frequent and grateful acknowledgments thereof by king
and parliament appear on their records<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>. But as Britain
has enjoyed a most gainful monopoly of our commerce,
the same, with our maintaining the dignity of
the king's representative in each colony, and all our
own separate establishments of government, civil and
military, has ever hitherto been deemed an equivalent
for such aids, as might otherwise be expected from us in
time of peace. And we hereby declare, that on a reconciliation
with Britain, we shall <em>not only</em> continue <em>to
grant aids in time of war</em>, as aforesaid; but, whenever
she shall think fit to abolish her monopoly, and give us
the same privileges of trade as Scotland received at the
union, and allow us a free commerce with all the rest
of the world, we shall willingly agree (and we doubt
not it will be ratified by our constituents) to <em>give and
pay</em> into the sinking fund [100,000<em>l.</em>] sterling per annum
for the term of one hundred years, which, duly, faithfully,
and inviolably applied to that purpose, is demonstrably
more than sufficient to extinguish <em>all her present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
national</em> debt, since it will in that time amount, at legal
British interest, to more than 230,000,000<em>l.</em><a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>But if Britain does not think fit to accept this proposition,
we, in order to remove her groundless jealousies,
<em>that we aim at independence, and an abolition of the
navigation act</em>, (which hath in truth never been our intention)
and to avoid all future disputes about the right
of making that and other acts for regulating our commerce,
do hereby declare ourselves ready and willing to
enter into a <em>covenant with Britain</em>, that she shall fully
possess, enjoy, and exercise that right, for an hundred
years to come, the same being <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ fide</i> used for the
common benefit; and in case of such agreement, that
every assembly be advised by us, to confirm it solemnly,
by laws of their own, which, once made, cannot be repealed
without the assent of the crown.</p>

<p>The last charge, <em>that we are dishonest traders, and aim
at defrauding our creditors in Britain</em>, is sufficiently and
authentically refuted by the solemn declarations of the
British merchants to parliament, (both at the time of
the stamp-act and in the last session) who bore ample
testimony to the general good faith and fair dealing of
the Americans, and declared their confidence in our
integrity, for which we refer to their petitions on the
journals of the house of commons. And we presume
we may safely call on the body of the British tradesmen,
who have had experience of both, to say, whether
they have not received much more punctual payment
from us than they generally have from the members of
their own two houses of parliament.</p>

<p>On the whole of the above it appears, that the charge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
of <em>ingratitude</em> towards the mother country, brought with
so much confidence against the colonies, is totally without
foundation; and that there is much more reason
for retorting that charge on Britain, who not only never
contributes any aid, nor affords, by an exclusive commerce,
any advantages to Saxony, <em>her</em> mother country;
but no longer since than in the last war, without the
least provocation, subsidized the king of Prussia while
he ravaged that <em>mother country</em>, and carried fire and
sword into its capital, the fine city of Dresden. An
example we hope no provocation will induce us to
imitate.</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>The congress met at a time when all minds were so
exasperated by the perfidy of general Gage, and his attack
on the country people, that propositions of attempting
an accomodation were not much relished; and
it has been with difficulty that we have carried another
humble petition to the crown, to give Britain one more
chance, one opportunity more of recovering the friendship
of the colonies; which however I think she has
not sense enough to embrace, and so I conclude she
has lost them for ever.</p>

<p>She has begun to burn our sea-port towns; secure, I
suppose, that we shall never be able to return the outrage
in kind. She may doubtless destroy them all;
but if she wishes to recover our commerce, are these
the probable means? She must certainly be distracted;
for no tradesman out of Bedlam ever thought of encreasing
the number of his customers by knocking them
[on] the head; or of enabling them to pay their debts
by burning their houses.</p>

<p>If she wishes to have us subjects and that we should
submit to her as our compound sovereign, she is now
giving us such miserable specimens of her government,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
that we shall ever detest and avoid it, as a complication
of robbery, murder, famine, fire and pestilence.</p>

<p>You will have heard, before this reaches you, of the
treacherous conduct *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* to the remaining people
in Boston, in detaining their goods, after stipulating
to let them go out with their effects, on pretence
that merchants' goods were not effects; the defeat of a
great body of his troops by the country people at Lexington;
some other small advantages gained in skirmishes
with their troops; and the action at Bunker's-hill,
in which they were twice repulsed, and the third
time gained a dear victory. Enough has happened, one
would think, to convince your ministers, that the Americans
will fight, and that this is a harder nut to crack
than they imagined.</p>

<p>We have not yet applied to any foreign power for
assistance, nor offered our commerce for their friendship.
Perhaps we never may: yet it is natural to think
of it, if we are pressed.</p>

<p>We have now an army on the establishment which
still holds yours besieged.</p>

<p>My time was never more fully employed. In the
morning at six, I am at the committee of safety, appointed
by the assembly to put the province in a state
of defence; which committee holds till near nine, when
I am at the congress, and that sits till after four in the
afternoon. Both these bodies proceed with the greatest
unanimity, and their meetings are well attended. It
will scarce be credited in Britain, that men can be as
diligent with us from zeal for the public good, as with
you for thousands per annum. Such is the difference
between uncorrupted new states, and corrupted old
ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>
<p>Great frugality and great industry are now become
fashionable here: gentlemen, who used to entertain with
two or three courses, pride themselves now in treating
with simple beef and pudding. By these means, and
the stoppage of our consumptive trade with Britain,
we shall be better able to pay our voluntary taxes for
the support of our troops. Our savings in the article
of trade amount to near five million sterling per annum.</p>

<p>I shall communicate your letter to Mr. Winthrop,
but the camp is at Cambridge, and he has as little leisure
for philosophy as myself. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Believe me
ever, with sincere esteem, my dear friend,</p>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Philadelphia, Oct. 3, 1775.</em></p>

<p>I wish as ardently as you can do for peace, and
should rejoice exceedingly in co-operating with you to
that end. But every ship from Britain brings some intelligence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
of new measures, that tend more and more to
exasperate: and it seems to me, that until you have
found by dear experience the reducing us by force impracticable,
you will think of nothing fair and reasonable.
We have as yet resolved only on defensive measures.
If you would recal your forces and stay at
home, we should meditate nothing to injure you. A
little time so given for cooling on both sides would
have excellent effects. But you will goad and provoke
us. You despise us too much; and you are insensible
of the Italian adage, that <em>there is no little enemy</em>. I am
persuaded the body of the British people are our
friends; but they are changeable, and by your lying
gazettes may soon be made our enemies. Our respect
for them will proportionally diminish; and I see clearly
we are on the high road to mutual enmity, hatred, and
detestation. A separation will of course be inevitable.
It is a million of pities so fair a plan, as we have hitherto
been engaged in for increasing strength and empire
with <em>public felicity</em>, should be destroyed by the mangling
hands of a few blundering ministers. It will not
be destroyed: God will protect and prosper it: you
will only exclude yourselves from any share in it. We
hear, that more ships and troops are coming out. We
know you may do us a great deal of mischief, but we
are determined to bear it patiently as long as we can;
but if you flatter yourselves with beating us into submission,
you know neither the people nor the country.</p>

of their <em>last</em> petition.</p>

<p>I received your several favours, of May 18,
June 30, and July 8, by Messrs. Vaillant and Pochard;
whom, if I could serve upon your recommendation, it
would give me great pleasure. Their total want of
English is at present an obstruction to their getting any
employment among us; but I hope they will soon obtain
some knowledge of it. This is a good country for
artificers or farmers, but gentlemen of mere science in
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les belles lettres</i> cannot so easily subsist here, there being
little demand for their assistance among an industrious
people, who, as yet, have not much leisure for studies
of that kind.</p>

<p>I am much obliged by the kind present you have
made us of your edition of <cite>Vattel</cite>. It came to us in
good season, when the circumstances of a rising state
make it necessary frequently to consult the law of nations.
Accordingly that copy which I kept (after depositing
one in our own public library here, and sending
the other to the college of Massachusett's Bay, as
you directed) has been continually in the hands of the
members of our congress, now sitting, who are much
pleased with your notes and preface, and have entertained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
a high and just esteem for their author. Your
manuscript <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Idée sur le government et <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'la royanté'">la royauté</ins></i>, is also
well relished, and may, in time, have its effect. I thank
you, likewise, for the other smaller pieces, which accompanied
Vattel. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le court exposé de ce qui s'est passé
entre la cour Br. et les colonies, &amp;c.</i> being a very concise
and clear statement of facts, will be reprinted here for
the use of our new friends in Canada. The translations
of the proceedings of our congress are very acceptable.
I <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'send yon'">send you</ins> herewith what of them has been farther
published here, together with a few newspapers, containing
accounts of some of the successes providence
has favoured us with. We are threatened from England
with a very powerful force, to come next year
against us. We are making all the provision in our
power here to oppose that force, and we hope we shall
be able to defend ourselves. But, as the events of war
are always uncertain, possibly, after another campaign,
we may find it necessary to ask aid of some foreign
power. It gives us great pleasure to learn from you,
that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toute l'Europe nous souhaite le plus heureux succes
pour le maintien de nos libertés</i>. But we wish to know,
whether any one of them, from principles of humanity,
is disposed magnanimously to step in for the relief of
an oppressed people, or whether, if, as it seems likely to
happen, we should be obliged to break off all connection
with Britain, and declare ourselves an independent
people, there is any state or power in Europe, who
would be willing to enter into an alliance with us for
the benefit of our commerce, which amounted, before
the war, to near seven millions sterling per annum, and
must continually increase, as our people increase most
rapidly. Confiding, my dear friend, in your good will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
to us and our cause, and in your sagacity and abilities
for business, the committee of congress, appointed for
the purpose of establishing and conducting a correspondence
with our friends in Europe, of which committee
I have the honour to be a member, have directed
me to request of you, that, as you are situated at the
Hague, where ambassadors from all the courts reside,
you would make use of the opportunity that situation
affords you, of discovering, if possible, the disposition
of the several courts with respect to such assistance or
alliance, if we should apply for the one, or propose the
other. As it may possibly be necessary, in particular
instances, that you should, for this purpose, confer directly
with some great ministers, and show them this
letter as your credential, we only recommend it to your
discretion, that you proceed therein with such caution,
as to keep the same from the knowledge of the English
ambassador, and prevent any public appearance, at
present, of your being employed in any such business,
as thereby, we imagine, many inconveniences may
be avoided, and your means of rendering us service,
increased.</p>

<p>That you may be better able to answer some questions,
which will probably be put to you, concerning
our present situation, we inform you&mdash;that the whole
continent is very firmly united&mdash;the party for the measures
of the British ministry being very small, and much
dispersed&mdash;that we have had on foot, the last campaign,
an army of near twenty-five thousand men, wherewith
we have been able, not only to block up the king's
army in Boston, but to spare considerable detachments
for the invasion of Canada, where we have met with
great success, as the printed papers sent herewith will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
inform you, and have now reason to expect the whole
province may be soon in our possession&mdash;that we purpose
greatly to increase our force for the ensuing year;
and thereby we hope, with the assistance of well-disciplined
militia, to be able to defend our coast, notwithstanding
its great extent&mdash;that we have already a small
squadron of armed vessels, to protect our coasting trade,
who have had some success in taking several of the enemy's
cruisers, and some of their transport vessels and
store-ships. This little naval force we are about to
augment, and expect it may be more considerable in
the next summer.</p>

<p>We have hitherto applied to no foreign power. We
are using the utmost industry in endeavouring
to make salt-petre, and with daily increasing success.
Our artificers are also every where busy in fabricating
small arms, casting cannon, &amp;c. yet both
arms and ammunition are much wanted. Any merchants,
who would venture to send ships, laden with
those articles, might make great profit; such is the demand
in every colony, and such generous prices are
and will be given; of which, and of the manner of conducting
such a voyage, the bearer, Mr. Storey, can
more fully inform you: and whoever brings in those
articles, is allowed to carry off the value in provisions,
to our West Indies, where they will probably fetch a
very high price, the general exportation from North
America being stopped. This you will see more particularly
in a printed resolution of the congress.</p>

<p>We are in great want of good engineers, and wish
you could engage, and send us two able ones, in time
for the next campaign, one acquainted with field service,
sieges, &amp;c. and the other with fortifying of sea-ports.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
They will, if well recommended, be made very
welcome, and have honourable appointments, besides
the expences of their voyage hither, in which Mr. Storey
can also advise them. As what we now request of you,
besides taking up your time, may put you to some expense,
we send you for the present, enclosed, a bill for
one hundred pounds sterling, to defray such expences,
and desire you to be assured that your services will be
considered, and honourably rewarded by the congress.</p>

<p>We desire, also, that you would take the trouble of
receiving from Arthur Lee, esquire, agent for the congress
in England, such letters as may be sent by him to
your care, and of forwarding them to us with your dispatches.
When you have occasion to write to him to
inform him of any thing, which it may be of importance
that our friends there should be acquainted with,
please to send your letters to him, under cover, directed
to Mr. Alderman Lee, merchant, on Tower-hill, London;
and do not send it by post, but by some trusty
shipper, or other prudent person, who will deliver it
with his own hand. And when you send to us, if you
have not a direct safe opportunity, we recommend
sending by way of St. Eustatia, to the care of Messrs.
Robert and Cornelius Stevenson, merchants there, who
will forward your dispatches to me.</p>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Eagle, June the 20th, 1776.</em></p>

<p>I cannot, my worthy friend, permit the letters
and parcels, which I have sent (in the state I received
them) to be landed, without adding a word upon the
subject of the injurious extremities in which our unhappy
disputes have engaged us.</p>

<p>You will learn the nature of my mission, from the
official dispatches which I have recommended to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
forwarded by the same conveyance. Retaining all the
earnestness I ever expressed, to see our differences accommodated;
I shall conceive, if I meet with the disposition
in the colonies which I was once taught to expect,
the most flattering hopes of proving serviceable
in the objects of the king's paternal solicitude, by promoting
the establishment of lasting peace and union
with the colonies. But if the deep-rooted prejudices
of America, and the necessity of preventing her trade
from passing into foreign channels, must keep us still a
divided people; I shall, from every private as well as
public motive, most heartily lament, that this is not the
moment wherein those great objects of my ambition are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
to be attained; and that I am to be longer deprived of

<p>P. S. I was disappointed of the opportunity I expected
for sending this letter, at the time it was dated;
and have ever since been prevented by calms and contrary
winds from getting here, to inform general Howe

<p><a name="Footnote_153_153" id="Footnote_153_153"></a><a href="#FNanchor_153_153"><span class="label">[153]</span></a> In the year 1776 an act of parliament passed, to prohibit and restrain,
on the one hand, the trade and intercourse of the refractory colonies respectively
during the revolt; and on the other hand, to enable persons appointed
by the crown to grant <em>pardons</em> and declare any particular district
at the <em>king's peace, &amp;c.</em> Lord Howe (who had been previously appointed
commander of the fleet in North America) was, on May 3, declared joint
<em>commissioner</em> with his brother gen. Howe, for the latter purposes of the
act. He sailed May 12; and while off the Massachusett's coast prepared
a declaration announcing this commission, and accompanied it with circular
letters. July 4, independence had been declared; but nevertheless
congress (invited by various attempts made to procure a conference) resolved
to send Messieurs Franklin, J. Adams, and E. Rutledge, to learn
the propositions of the commissioners, by whom authorized, and to whom
addressed. The commissioners having no power to treat with congress in
its public capacity, and congress not being impowered by their representatives
to rescind the act of independence, the conference was broken off.
It remains only to add, that, on Sept. 19, the commissioners declared
themselves ready to confer with any of the well-affected, on the means of
restoring peace and permanent union with every colony as part of the
British empire; and promised a <em>revision</em> of the several royal <em>instructions</em>
supposed to lay improper restraints on colony-legislation, and also the
king's <em>concurrence</em> in a revision of the objectionable acts of parliament:
which seemed the ultimatum of the commission.&mdash;Parliament however, by
a subsequent act (which, among other things, formally renounced taxation
in North America and the West Indies) authorized five commissioners to
treat, settle, and agree, even with congress; but subject to the farther
confirmation of parliament. Lord Carlisle, and Messieurs Johnson and
Eden, with the commanders in chief of the land and sea forces, were the
commissioners appointed by the crown under this act; and Dr. Adam
Ferguson was made secretary to the commission.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Henry Strachey had been secretary to the <em>first</em> commission, attended
with the following singular circumstance, as stated in the house of lords.
In this commission for restoring peace to America, "(or <em>in other words</em> to
induce America at once to put a confidence in the crown, and to believe
that the parliament of England is a sufficiently powerful and honest barrier
for them to trust to) the secretary (Mr. Strachey) had 500<em>l.</em> granted
for life out of the <em>four and a half</em> per cent. duty, filched by the crown
from the West-India Islands, and in opposition to a solemn address of parliament
desiring that it might be applied to the original purposes for
which it was granted by the respective assemblies of the islands."&mdash;What
these original purposes of the grants were, I meant very briefly to have
stated: but have not been able to procure the proper documents in time.

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Dr. Franklin's Answer to Lord Howe.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Philadelphia, July 30, 1776.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">My Lord,</p>

<p>I received safe the letters your lordship so kindly
forwarded to me, and beg you to accept <em>my</em> thanks.</p>

<p>The official dispatches to which you refer me, contain
nothing more than what we had seen in the act of
parliament, viz. "Offers of pardon upon submission;"
which I was sorry to find; as it must give your lordship
pain to be sent so far on so hopeless a business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>
<p>Directing pardons to be offered to the colonies, who
are the very parties injured, expresses indeed that opinion
of our ignorance, baseness, and insensibility, which
your uninformed and proud nation has long been
pleased to entertain of us; but it can have no other
effect than that of encreasing our resentments.&mdash;&mdash;It is
impossible we should think of submission to a government,
that has, with the most wanton barbarity and cruelty,
burned our defenceless towns in the midst of winter;
excited the savages to massacre our (peaceful) farmers;
and our slaves to murder their masters; and is even
now<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> bringing foreign mercenaries to deluge our settlements
with blood. These atrocious injuries have extinguished
every spark of affection for that parent country
we once held so dear: but were it possible for <em>us</em> to
forget and forgive them, it is not possible for <em>you</em> (I
mean the British nation) to forgive the people you have
so heavily injured; you can never confide again in
those as fellow-subjects, and permit them to enjoy
equal freedom, to whom you know you have given such
just causes of lasting enmity; and this must impel you,
were we again under your government, to endeavour
the breaking our spirit by the severest tyranny, and obstructing
by every means in your power our growing
strength and prosperity.</p>

<p>But your lordship mentions "the king's paternal solicitude
for promoting the establishment of lasting
peace and union with the colonies." If by <em>peace</em> is here
meant, a peace to be entered into by distinct states,
now at war; and his majesty has given your lordship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
powers to treat with us of such a peace, I may venture
to say, though without authority, that I think a treaty
for that purpose not quite impracticable, before we
enter into foreign alliances. But I am persuaded you
have no such powers. Your nation, though, by punishing
those American governors who have fomented the
discord, rebuilding our burnt towns, and repairing as
far as possible the mischiefs done us, she might recover
a great share of our regard; and the greatest share of
our growing commerce, with all the advantages of that
additional strength, to be derived from a friendship with
us; yet I know too well her abounding pride and deficient
wisdom, to believe she will ever take such salutary
measures. Her fondness for conquest as a warlike
nation; her lust of dominion as an ambitious one; and
her thirst for a gainful monopoly as a commercial one
(none of them legitimate causes of war) will join to hide
from her eyes every view of her true interest, and continually
goad her on in these ruinous distant expeditions,
so destructive both of lives and of treasure, that
they must prove as pernicious to her in the end, as the
Croisades formerly were to most of the nations of
Europe.</p>

<p>I have not the vanity, my lord, to think of intimidating,
by thus predicting the effects of this war; for I
know it will in England have the fate of all my former
predictions; not to be believed till the event shall verify
it.</p>

<p>Long did I endeavour, with unfeigned and unwearied
zeal, to preserve from breaking that fine and noble
porcelaine vase&mdash;&mdash;the British empire; for I knew that
being once broken, the separate parts could not retain
even their <em>share</em> of the strength and value that existed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
in the whole; and that a perfect <em>re-union</em> of those parts
could scarce ever be hoped for. Your lordship may
possibly remember the tears of joy that wetted my cheek,
when, at your good sister's in London, you once gave
me expectations, that a reconciliation might soon take
place. I had the misfortune to find these expectations
disappointed, and to be treated as the cause of the mischief
I was labouring to prevent. My consolation
under that groundless and malevolent treatment was,
that I retained the friendship of many wise and good
men in that country; and among the rest, some share
in the regard of lord Howe.</p>

<p>The well-founded esteem, and permit me to say affection,
which I shall always have for your lordship, make
it painful to me to see you engaged in conducting a
war, the great ground of which (as described in your
letter) is "the necessity of preventing the American
<em>trade</em> from passing into foreign channels." To me it
seems, that neither the obtaining or retaining any trade,
how valuable soever, is an object for which men may
justly spill each other's blood; that the true and sure
means of extending and securing commerce are the
goodness and cheapness of commodities; and that the
profits of no trade can ever be equal to the expence of
compelling it, and holding it by fleets and armies. I
consider this war against us, therefore, as both unjust
and unwise; and I am persuaded, that cool and dispassionate
posterity will condemn to infamy those who advised
it; and that even success will not save from some
degree of dishonour, those who have voluntarily engaged
to conduct it.</p>

<p>I know your great motive in coming hither, was the
hope of being instrumental in a reconciliation; and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
believe, when you find that to be impossible, on any
terms given you to propose, you will then relinquish so
odious a command, and return to a more honourable
private station.</p>

<p>With the greatest and most sincere respect, I have
the honour to be,</p>

<p class="right padr8">My lord,</p>

<p class="right padr4">Your lordship's most obedient, humble servant,</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_155_155" id="Footnote_155_155"></a><a href="#FNanchor_155_155"><span class="label">[155]</span></a> It occurs to me to mention that Dr. Franklin was supposed to have
been the inventor of a little <em>emblematical design</em> at the commencement of
our disputes, representing the state of Great Britain and her colonies,
should the former persist in restraining the latter's trade, destroying their
currency, and taxing their people by laws made by a legislature in which
they were not represented.&mdash;Great Britain was supposed to have been
placed upon the globe: but the colonies, her limbs, being severed from
her, she was seen lifting her eyes and mangled stumps to heaven; her
shield, which she was unable to wield, lay useless by her side; her lance
had pierced New England; the laurel branch was fallen from the hand of
Pensylvania; the English oak had lost its head, and stood a bare trunk
with a few withered branches; briars and thorns were on the ground beneath
it; our ships had brooms at their topmast heads, denoting their
being upon sale; and Britannia herself was seen sliding off the world, no
longer able to hold its balance; her fragments overspread with the label
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">date obolum Belisario</i>.&mdash;This in short, was the fable of the belly and the
members reversed. But I tell the story chiefly for the sake of the <em>moral</em>,
which has the air of having been suggested by Dr. Franklin<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>; and is as
follows.&mdash;"The political moral of this picture is now easily discovered.
History affords us many instances of the ruin of states, by the prosecution
of measures ill suited to the temper and genius of its people. The ordaining
of laws in favour of <em>one</em> part of the nation, to the prejudice and oppression
of <em>another</em>, is certainly the most erroneous and mistaken policy.
An <em>equal</em> dispensation of protection, rights, privileges, and advantages, is
what every part is intitled to, and ought to enjoy; it being a matter of no
moment to the state, whether a subject grows rich and flourishing on the
Thames or the Ohio, in Edinburgh or Dublin. These measures never fail
to create great and violent jealousies and animosities between the people
favoured and the people oppressed: from whence a total separation of
affections, interests, political obligations, and all manners of connections,
necessarily ensues; by which the whole state is weakened and perhaps
ruined for ever."
</p>
<p>
This language is part of the same system with the following fragment of
a sentence, which Dr. Franklin inserted in a political publication of one of
his friends. "The attempts to establish <em>arbitrary power</em> over so great a
part of the British empire, [are] to the imminent hazard of our most valuable
commerce, and of that national strength, security, and felicity, which
depend on <em>union</em> and <em>liberty</em>;"&mdash;The preservation of which, I am told, he
used to say, had been the great object and labour of his life; the whole
being such a thing <em>as the world before never saw</em>. B.&nbsp;V.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_156_156" id="Footnote_156_156"></a><a href="#FNanchor_156_156"><span class="label">[156]</span></a> This design was printed on a <em>card</em>, and Dr. Franklin at the time I believe
occasionally used to write his notes on such cards. It was also printed
on a <em>half sheet of paper</em>, with an explanation by some other person, and the
moral given above. The drawing was but moderately executed.</p></div></div>

<p>In borrowing money a man's credit depends on some
or all of the following particulars.</p>

<p>First, His known conduct respecting former loans,
and his punctuality in discharging them.</p>

<p>Secondly, His industry.</p>

<p>Thirdly, His frugality.</p>

<p>Fourthly, The amount and the certainty of his income,
and the freedom of his estate from the incumbrances
of prior debts.</p>

<p>Fifthly, His well founded prospects of greater future
ability, by the improvement of his estate in value, and
by aids from others.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>
<p>Sixthly, His known prudence in managing his general
affairs, and the advantage they will probably receive
from the loan which he desires.</p>

<p>Seventhly, His known probity and honest character,
manifested by his voluntary discharge of debts, which
he could not have been legally compelled to pay. The
circumstances which give credit to an <em>individual</em> ought
to have, and will have, their weight upon the lenders of
money to <em>public bodies</em> or nations. If then we consider
and compare Britain and America, in these several particulars,
upon the question, "To which is it safest to
lend money?" We shall find,</p>

<p>1. Respecting <em>former loans</em>, that America, which
borrowed ten millions during the last war for the maintenance
of her army of 25,000 men and other charges,
had faithfully discharged and paid that debt, and all
her other debts, in 1772. Whereas Britain, during
those ten years of peace and profitable commerce, had
made little or no reduction of her debt; but on the
contrary, from time to time, diminished the hopes of
her creditors, by a wanton diversion and misapplication
of the sinking fund destined for discharging it.</p>

<p>2. Respecting <em>industry</em>; every man [in America] is
employed, the greater part in cultivating their own
lands, the rest in handicrafts, navigation, and commerce.
An idle man there is a rarity, idleness and
inutility are disgraceful. In England, the number of
that character is immense, fashion has spread it far and
wide; hence the embarrassments of private fortunes,
and the daily bankruptcies arising from an universal
fondness for appearance and expensive pleasures; and
hence, in some degree, the mismanagement of public
business; for habits of business, and ability in it, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
acquired only by practice; and where universal dissipation,
and the perpetual pursuit of amusement are the
mode, the youth, educated in it, can rarely afterwards
acquire that patient attention and close application to
affairs, which are so necessary to a statesman charged
with the care of national welfare. <em>Hence</em> their frequent
errors in policy, and hence the weariness at public
councils, and backwardness in going to them, the constant
unwillingness to engage in any measure that requires
thought and consideration, and the readiness for
postponing every new proposition; which postponing
is therefore the only part of business that they come to
be expert in, an expertness produced necessarily by so
much daily practice. Whereas in America, men bred
to close employment in their private affairs, attend with
ease to those of the public, when engaged in them, and
nothing fails through negligence.</p>

<p>3. Respecting <em>frugality</em>; the manner of living in
America is more simple and less expensive than that in
England: plain tables, plain clothing, and plain furniture
in houses prevail, with few carriages of pleasure;
there, an expensive appearance hurts credit, and is
avoided: in England, it is often assumed to gain credit,
and continued to ruin. Respecting <em>public</em> affairs,
the difference is still greater. In England, the salaries
of officers, and emoluments of office are enormous.
The king has a million sterling per annum, and yet
cannot maintain his family free of debt: secretaries of
state, lords of treasury, admiralty, &amp;c. have vast appointments:
an auditor of the exchequer has sixpence
in the pound, or a fortieth part of all the public money
expended by the nation; so that when a war costs forty
millions one million is paid to him: an inspector of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
mint, in the last new coinage, received as his fee
65,000<em>l.</em> sterling per annum; to all which rewards no
service these gentlemen can render the public is by any
means equivalent. All this is paid by the people, who
are oppressed by taxes so occasioned, and thereby rendered
less able to contribute to the payment of necessary
national debts. In America, salaries, where indispensible,
are extremely low; but much of the public
business is done gratis. The honour of serving the
public ably and faithfully is deemed sufficient. <em>Public
spirit</em> really exists there, and has great effects. In England
it is universally deemed a non-entity, and whoever
pretends to it is laughed at as a fool, or suspected as a
knave. The committees of congress which form the
board of war, the board of treasury, the board of foreign
affairs, the naval board, that for accounts, &amp;c. all attend
the business of their respective functions, without any
salary or emolument whatever, though they spend in it
much more of their time than any lord of treasury or
admiralty in England can spare from his amusements.
A British minister lately computed, that the whole
expence of the Americans, in their <em>civil</em> government
over three millions of people amounted to but 70,000<em>l.</em>
sterling, and drew from thence a conclusion, that they
ought to be taxed, until their expence was equal in proportion
to that which it costs Britain to govern eight
millions. He had no idea of a contrary conclusion,
that if three millions may be well governed for 70,000<em>l.</em>
eight millions may be as well governed for three times
that sum, and that therefore the expence of his own
government should be diminished. In that corrupted
nation no man is ashamed of being concerned in lucrative
<em>government jobs</em>, in which the public money is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
egregiously misapplied and squandered, the treasury
pillaged, and more numerous and heavy taxes accumulated,
to the great oppression of the people. But the
prospect of a greater number of such jobs by a war is
an inducement with many, to cry out for war upon all
occasions, and to oppose every proposition of peace.
Hence the constant increase of the national debt,
and the absolute improbability of its ever being discharged.</p>

<p>4. Respecting the <em>amount and certainty of income, and
solidity of security</em>; the <em>whole</em> thirteen states of America
are engaged for the payment of every debt contracted
by the congress, and the debt to be contracted by the
present war is the <em>only</em> debt they will have to pay; all,
or nearly all, the former debts of particular colonies being
already discharged. Whereas England will have
to pay not only the enormous debt this war must occasion,
but all their vast preceding debt, or the interest of
it,&mdash;and while America is enriching itself by prizes
made upon the British commerce, more than it ever
did by any commerce of its own, under the restraints of
a British monopoly; Britain is growing poorer by the
loss of that monopoly, and the diminution of its revenues,
and of course less able to discharge the present
indiscreet increase of its expences.</p>

<p>5. Respecting prospects of greater future ability,
Britain has none such. Her islands are circumscribed
by the ocean; and excepting a few parks or forests,
she has no new land to cultivate, and cannot therefore
extend her improvements. Her numbers too, instead
of increasing from increased subsistence, are continually
diminishing from growing luxury, and the increasing
difficulties of maintaining families, which of course discourage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
early marriages. Thus she will have fewer
people to assist in paying her debts, and that diminished
number will be poorer. America, on the contrary,
has, besides her lands already cultivated, a vast territory
yet to be cultivated; which, being cultivated, continually
increases in value with the increase of people; and the
people, who double themselves by a <em>natural propagation</em>
every twenty-five years, will double yet faster, by the
accession of <em>strangers</em>, as long as lands are to be had for
new families; so that every twenty years there will be
a double number of inhabitants obliged to discharge
the public debts; and those inhabitants, being more
opulent, may pay their shares with greater ease.</p>

<p>6. Respecting <em>prudence</em> in general affairs, and the
advantages to be expected from the loan desired; the
Americans are cultivators of land; those engaged in
fishery and commerce are few, compared with the
others. They have ever conducted their several governments
with wisdom, avoiding wars, and vain expensive
projects, delighting only in their peaceable
occupations, which must, considering the extent of
their uncultivated territory, find them employment still
for ages. Whereas England, ever unquiet, ambitious,
avaricious, imprudent, and quarrelsome, is half of the
time engaged in war, always at an expence infinitely
greater than the advantage to be obtained by it, if successful.
Thus they made war against Spain in 1739,
for a claim of about 95,000<em>l.</em> (scarce a groat for each
individual of the nation) and spent forty millions sterling
in the war, and the lives of fifty thousand men;
and finally made peace without obtaining satisfaction
for the sum claimed. Indeed, there is scarce a nation
in Europe, against which she has not made war on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
some frivolous pretext or other, and thereby imprudently
accumulated a debt, that has brought her on the
verge of bankruptcy. But the most indiscreet of all
her wars, is the present against America, with whom
she might, for ages, have preserved her profitable connection
only by a just and equitable conduct. She is
now acting like a mad shop-keeper, who, by beating
those that pass his doors, attempts to make them come
in and be his customers. America cannot submit to
such treatment, without being first ruined, and, being
ruined, her custom will be worth nothing. England, to
effect this, is increasing her debt, and irretrievably
ruining herself. America, on the other hand, aims only
to establish her liberty, and that freedom of commerce
which will be advantageous to all Europe; and by
abolishing that monopoly which she laboured under,
she will profit infinitely more than enough to repay any
debt, which she may contract to accomplish it.</p>

<p>7. Respecting <em>character in the honest payment of debts</em>;
the punctuality with which America has discharged her
public debts was shown under the first head. And the
general good disposition of the people to such punctuality
has been manifested in their faithful payment of
<em>private</em> debts to England, since the commencement of
this war. There were not wanting some politicians [in
America] who proposed <em>stopping that payment</em>, until
peace should be restored, alleging, that in the usual
course of commerce, and of the credit given, there was
always a debt existing equal to the trade of eighteen
months: that the trade amounting to five millions sterling
per annum, the debt must be seven millions and an
half; that this sum paid to the British merchants would
operate to prevent that distress, intended to be brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
upon Britain, by our stoppage of commerce with her;
for the merchants, receiving this money, and no orders
with it for farther supplies, would either lay it out in
the public funds, or in employing manufacturers to
accumulate goods for a future hungry market in America
upon an expected accommodation, by which
means the funds would be kept up and the manufacturers
prevented from murmuring. But <em>against this it
was alleged</em>, that injuries from ministers should not be
revenged on merchants; that the credit was in consequence
of private contracts, made in confidence of
good faith; that these ought to be held sacred and faithfully
complied with; for that, whatever public utility
might be supposed to arise from a breach of private
faith, it was unjust, and would in the end be found unwise&mdash;honesty
being in truth the best policy. On this
principle the proposition was universally rejected; and
though the English prosecuted the war with unexampled
barbarity, burning our defenceless towns in the
midst of winter, and arming savages against us; the
debt was punctually paid; and the merchants of London
have testified to the parliament, and will testify to
all the world, that from their experience in dealing
with us they had, before the war, no apprehension of
our unfairness; and that since the war they have been
convinced, that their good opinion of us was well founded.
England, on the contrary, an old, corrupt, extravagant,
and profligate nation, sees herself deep in debt,
which she is in no condition to pay; and yet is madly,
and dishonestly running deeper, without any possibility
of discharging her debt, but by a public bankruptcy.</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, from the general industry, frugality,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
ability, prudence, and virtue of America, that
she is a much safer debtor than Britain;&mdash;to say nothing
of the satisfaction generous minds must have in reflecting,
that by loans to America they are opposing tyranny,
and aiding the cause of liberty, which is the cause
of all mankind.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="drcap">S</span>avages we call them, because their manners differ
from ours, which we think the perfection of civility;
they think the same of theirs.</p>

<p>Perhaps, if we could examine the manners of different
nations with impartiality, we should find no people
so rude, as to be without any rules of politeness; nor
any so polite, as not to have some remains of rudeness.</p>

<p>The Indian men, when young, are hunters and warriors;
when old, counsellors; for all their government
is by the council or advice of the sages; there is no
force, there are no prisons, no officers to compel obedience,
or inflict punishment. Hence they generally
study oratory, the best speaker having the most influence.
The Indian women till the ground, dress the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
food, nurse and bring up the children, and preserve and
hand down to posterity the memory of public transactions.
These employments of men and women are
accounted natural and honourable. Having few artificial
wants, they have abundance of leisure for improvement
by conversation. Our laborious manner of life,
compared with theirs, they esteem slavish and base; and
the learning on which we value ourselves, they regard
as frivolous and useless. An instance of this occurred
at the treaty of Lancaster, in Pensylvania, anno 1744,
between the government of Virginia and the six nations.
After the principal business was settled, the
commissioners from Virginia acquainted the Indians by
a speech, that there was at Williamsburg a college,
with a fund, for educating Indian youth; and that if
the chiefs of the Six Nations would send down half a
dozen of their sons to that college, the government
would take care that they should be well provided for,
and instructed in all the learning of the white people.
It is one of the Indian rules of politeness, not to answer
a public proposition the same day that it is made;
they think it would be treating it as a light matter, and
that they show it respect by taking time to consider it,
as of a matter important. They therefore deferred
their answer till the day following; when their speaker
began, by expressing their deep sense of the kindness
of the Virginia government, in making them that offer;
"for we know," says he, "that you highly esteem the
kind of learning taught in those colleges, and that the
maintenance of our young men, while with you, would
be very expensive to you. We are convinced therefore,
that you mean to do us good by your proposal;
and we thank you heartily. But you, who are wise, must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
know, that different nations have different conceptions
of things; and you will therefore not take it amiss, if
our ideas of this kind of education happen not to be the
same with yours. We have had some experience of
it: several of our young people were formerly brought
up at the colleges of the northern provinces; they were
instructed in all your sciences; but when they came
back to us, they were bad runners, ignorant of every
means of living in the woods, unable to bear either cold
or hunger, knew neither how to build a cabin, take a
deer, or kill an enemy, spoke our language imperfectly,
were therefore neither fit for hunters, warriors, or counsellors;
they were totally good for nothing. We are
however not the less obliged by your kind offer, though
we decline accepting it: and to show our grateful sense
of it, if the gentlemen of Virginia will send us a dozen
of their sons, we will take great care of their education,
instruct them in all we know, and make <em>men</em> of them."</p>

<p>Having frequent occasions to hold public councils,
they have acquired great order and decency in conducting
them. The old men sit in the foremost ranks, the
warriors in the next, and the women and children in the
hindmost. The business of the women is to take exact
notice of what passes, imprint it in their memories, for
they have no writing, and communicate it to their children.
They are the records of the council, and they
preserve tradition of the stipulations in treaties a hundred
years back; which, when we compare with our
writings, we always find exact. He that would speak,
rises. The rest observe a profound silence. When he
has finished and sits down, they leave him five or six
minutes to recollect, that, if he has omitted any thing
he intended to say, or has any thing to add, he may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
rise again and deliver it. To interrupt another, even in
common conversation, is reckoned highly indecent.
How different this is from the conduct of a polite British
house of commons, where scarce a day passes without
some confusion, that makes the speaker hoarse in
calling <em>to order</em>; and how different from the mode of
conversation in many polite companies of Europe,
where, if you do not deliver your sentence with great
rapidity, you are cut off in the middle of it by the impatient
loquacity of those you converse with, and never
suffered to finish it!</p>

<p>The politeness of these savages in conversation is
indeed carried to excess, since it does not permit them
to contradict or deny the truth of what is asserted in
their presence. By this means they indeed avoid disputes;
but then it becomes difficult to know their
minds, or what impression you make upon them. The
missionaries who have attempted to convert them to
christianity, all complain of this as one of the great difficulties
of their mission. The Indians hear with patience
the truths of the gospel explained to them, and
give their usual tokens of assent and approbation: you
would think they were convinced. No such matter. It
is mere civility.</p>

<p>A Swedish minister, having assembled the chiefs of
the Sasquehannah Indians, made a sermon to them,
acquainting them with the principal historical facts on
which our religion is founded; such as the fall of our
first parents by eating an apple, the coming of Christ
to repair the mischief, his miracles and suffering, &amp;c.&mdash;When
he had finished, an Indian orator stood up to
thank him. "What you have told us," says he, "is
all very good. It is indeed bad to eat apples. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
better to make them all into cyder. We are much
obliged by your kindness in coming so far, to tell us
those things which you have heard from your mothers.
In return, I will tell you some of those we have heard
from ours.</p>

<p>"In the beginning, our fathers had only the flesh of
animals to subsist on, and if their hunting was unsuccessful,
they were starving. Two of our young hunters
having killed a deer, made a fire in the woods to broil
some parts of it. When they were about to satisfy
their hunger, they beheld a beautiful young woman
descend from the clouds, and seat herself on that hill
which you see yonder among the Blue Mountains.
They said to each other, it is a spirit that perhaps has
smelt our broiling venison, and wishes to eat of it: let
us offer some to her. They presented her with the
tongue: she was pleased with the taste of it, and said,
Your kindness shall be rewarded. Come to this place
after thirteen moons, and you shall find something that
will be of great benefit in nourishing you and your
children to the latest generations. They did so, and to
their surprise, found plants they had never seen before;
but which, from that ancient time, have been constantly
cultivated among us, to our great advantage. Where
her right hand had touched the ground, they found
maize; where her left hand had touched it, they found
kidney-beans; and where her backside had sat on it,
they found tobacco." The good missionary, disgusted
with this idle tale, said, "What I delivered to you
were sacred truths, but what you tell me is mere fable,
fiction, and falsehood." The Indian, offended, replied,
"My brother, it seems your friends have not done you
justice in your education; they have not well instructed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
you in the rules of common civility. You saw that
we, who understand and practice those rules, believed
all your stories, why do you refuse to believe ours?"</p>

<p>When any of them come into our towns, our people
are apt to crowd round them, gaze upon them, and incommode
them where they desire to be private; this
they esteem great rudeness, and the effect of the want
of instruction in the rules of civility and good manners.
"We have," say they, "as much curiosity as you, and
when you come into our towns, we wish for opportunities
of looking at you; but for this purpose we hide
ourselves behind bushes, where you are to pass, and
never intrude ourselves into your company."</p>

<p>Their manner of entering one another's villages has
likewise its rules. It is reckoned uncivil in travelling
strangers, to enter a village abruptly, without giving
notice of their approach. Therefore, as soon as they
arrive within hearing, they stop and hollow, remaining
there till invited to enter. Two old men usually come
out to them, and lead them in. There is in every village
a vacant dwelling, called the strangers' house.
Here they are placed, while the old men go round
from hut to hut, acquainting the inhabitants, that strangers
are arrived, who are probably hungry and weary;
and every one sends them what he can spare of victuals,
and skins to repose on. When the strangers are refreshed,
pipes and tobacco are brought; and then, but
not before, conversation begins, with enquiries who
they are, whither bound, what news, &amp;c. and it usually
ends with offers of service, if the strangers have occasion
for guides, or any necessaries for continuing their
journey; and nothing is exacted for the entertainment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>
<p>The same hospitality, esteemed among them as a
principal virtue, is practised by private persons; of
which <em>Conrad Weiser</em>, our <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'intrepreter'">interpreter</ins>, gave me the following
instance. He had been naturalized among the
Six Nations, and spoke well the Mohuck language. In
going through the Indian country, to carry a message
from our governor to the council at Onondaga, he
called at the habitation of Canassetego, an old acquaintance,
who embraced him, spread furs for him to sit
on, and placed before him some boiled beans and venison,
and mixed some rum and water for his drink.
When he was well refreshed, and had lit his pipe,
Canassetego began to converse with him: asked how
he had fared the many years since they had seen each
other, whence he then came, what occasioned the journey,
&amp;c. Conrad answered all his questions; and
when the discourse began to flag, the Indian, to continue
it, said, "Conrad, you have lived long among the
white people, and know something of their customs; I
have been sometimes at Albany, and have observed,
that once in seven days they shut up their shops, and
assemble all in the great house; tell me what it is for?
What do they do there?" "They meet there," says
Conrad, "to hear and learn <em>good things</em>." "I do not
doubt," says the Indian, "that they tell you so; they
have told me the same: but I doubt the truth of what
they say, and I will tell you my reasons. I went lately
to Albany to sell my skins and buy blankets, knives,
powder, rum, &amp;c. You know I used generally to deal
with Hans Hanson; but I was a little inclined this time
to try some other merchants. However, I called first
upon Hans, and asked him what he would give for
beaver. He said he could not give more than four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
shillings a pound: but, says he, I cannot talk on business
now; this is the day when we meet together to
learn <em>good things</em>, and I am going to the meeting. So
I thought to myself, since I cannot do any business to-day,
I may as well go to the meeting too, and I went
with him. There stood up a man in black, and began
to talk to the people very angrily. I did not understand
what he said; but perceiving that he looked
much at me, and at Hanson, I imagined he was angry
at seeing me there; so I went out, sat down near the
house, struck fire, and lit my pipe, waiting till the meeting
should break up. I thought too, that the man had
mentioned something of beaver, and I suspected it
might be the subject of their meeting. So when they
came out I accosted my merchant. Well, Hans, says
I, I hope you have agreed to give more than four
shillings a pound? No, says he, I cannot give so
much, I cannot give more than three shillings and sixpence.
I then spoke to several other dealers, but they
all sung the same song, three and sixpence, three and
sixpence. This made it clear to me that my suspicion
was right; and that whatever they pretended of meeting
to learn <em>good things</em>, the real purpose was to consult
how to cheat Indians in the price of beaver. Consider
but a little, Conrad, and you must be of my opinion.
If they met so often to learn <em>good things</em>, they would
certainly have learned some before this time. But
they are still ignorant. You know our practice. If a
white man, in travelling through our country, enters
one of our cabins, we all treat him as I do you; we
dry him if he is wet, we warm him if he is cold, and
give him meat and drink, that he may allay his thirst
and hunger; and we spread soft furs for him to rest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
and sleep on: we demand nothing in return<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>. But if
I go into a white man's house at Albany, and ask for
victuals and drink, they say, Where is your money?
and if I have none, they say, Get out you Indian dog.
You see they have not yet learned those little <em>good things</em>,
that we need no meetings to be instructed in, because
our mothers taught them to us when we were children;
and therefore it is impossible their meetings should be,
as they say, for any such purpose, or have any such
effect; they are only to contrive <em>the cheating of Indians
in the price of beaver</em>."</p>

allowed as the virtue of those, whom the civilized were pleased to call
Barbarians. The Greeks celebrated the Scythians for it, the Saracens
possessed it eminently; and it is to this day the reigning virtue of the wild
Arabs. St. Paul too, in the relation of his voyage and shipwreck, on the
island of Melita, says, "The barbarous people shewed us no little kindness;
for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the
present rain, and because of the cold."</p></div></div>

<h3 class="negidt1"><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>The internal State of America; being a true Description
of the Interest and Policy of that vast Continent.</em></a></h3>

<p>There is a tradition, that, in the planting of New-England,
the first settlers met with many difficulties
and hardships; as is generally the case when a civilized
people attempt establishing themselves in a wilderness
country. Being piously disposed, they sought relief
from Heaven, by laying their wants and distresses before
the Lord, in frequent set days of fasting and prayer.
Constant meditation and discourse on these subjects
kept their minds gloomy and discontented; and, like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
the children of Israel, there were many disposed to return
to that Egypt, which persecution had induced
them to abandon. At length, when it was proposed in
the assembly to proclaim another fast, a farmer of plain
sense rose, and remarked, that the inconveniences they
suffered, and concerning which they had so often wearied
heaven with their complaints, were not so great as
they might have expected, and were diminishing every
day as the colony strengthened; that the earth began
to reward their labour, and to furnish liberally for their
subsistence; that the seas and rivers were found full of
fish, the air sweet, the climate healthy; and, above all,
that they were there in the full enjoyment of liberty,
civil and religious: he therefore thought, that reflecting
and conversing on these subjects would be more
comfortable, as tending more to make them contented
with their situation; and that it would be more becoming
the gratitude they owed to the Divine Being, if,
instead of a fast, they should proclaim a thanksgiving.
His advice was taken; and from that day to this they
have, in every year, observed circumstances of public
felicity sufficient to furnish employment for a thanksgiving
day; which is therefore constantly ordered and
religiously observed.</p>

<p>I see in the public newspapers of different states frequent
complaints of <em>hard times, deadness of trade, scarcity
of money, &amp;c. &amp;c.</em> It is not my intention to assert or
maintain, that these complaints are entirely without
foundation. There can be no country or nation existing,
in which there will not be some people so circumstanced,
as to find it hard to gain a livelihood; people
who are not in the way of any profitable trade, and with
whom money is scarce, because they have nothing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
give in exchange for it; and it is always in the power
of a small number to make a great clamour. But
let us take a cool view of the general state of our affairs,
and perhaps the prospect will appear less gloomy than
has been imagined.</p>

<p>The great business of the continent is agriculture.
For one artisan, or merchant, I suppose, we have at
least one hundred farmers, by far the greatest part cultivators
of their own fertile lands, from whence many
of them draw not only food necessary for their subsistence,
but the materials of their clothing, so as to need
very few foreign supplies; while they have a surplus of
productions to dispose of, whereby wealth is gradually
accumulated. Such has been the goodness of Divine
Providence to these regions, and so favourable the climate,
that, since the three or four years of hardship in
the first settlement of our fathers here, a famine or
scarcity has never been heard of amongst us; on the
contrary, though some years may have been more, and
others less plentiful, there has always been provision
enough for ourselves, and a quantity to spare for exportation.
And although the crops of last year were
generally good, never was the farmer better paid for the
part he can spare commerce, as the published price
currents abundantly testify. The lands he possesses are
also continually rising in value with the increase of population;
and, on the whole, he is enabled to give such
good wages to those who work for him, that all who
are acquainted with the old world must agree, that in
no part of it are the labouring poor so generally well
fed, well clothed, well lodged, and well paid, as in the
United States of America.</p>

<p>If we enter the cities, we find, that, since the revolution,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
the owners of houses and lots of ground have had
their interest vastly augmented in value; rents have
risen to an astonishing height, and thence encouragement
to increase building, which gives employment to
an abundance of workmen, as does also the increased
luxury and splendour of living of the inhabitants, thus
made richer. These workmen all demand and obtain
much higher wages than any other part of the world
would afford them, and are paid in ready money. This
rank of people therefore do not, or ought not, to complain
of hard times; and they make a very considerable
part of the city inhabitants.</p>

<p>At the distance I live from our American fisheries, I
cannot speak of them with any degree of certainty; but
I have not heard, that the labour of the valuable race of
men employed in them is worse paid, or that they meet
with less success, than before the revolution. The
whale-men indeed have been deprived of one market for
their oil; but another, I hear, is opening for them,
which it is hoped may be equally advantageous; and
the demand is constantly increasing for their spermaceti
candles, which therefore bear a much higher price than
formerly.</p>

<p>There remain the merchants and shopkeepers. Of
these, though they make but a small part of the whole
nation, the number is considerable, too great indeed
for the business they are employed in; for the consumption
of goods in every country has its limits; the
faculties of the people, that is, their ability to buy and
pay, being equal only to a certain quantity of merchandize.
If merchants calculate amiss on this proportion, and
import too much, they will of course find the sale dull
for the overplus, and some of them will say, that trade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
languishes. They should, and doubtless will, grow
wiser by experience, and import less. If too many artificers
in town, and farmers from the country, flattering
themselves with the idea of leading easier lives, turn
shopkeepers, the whole natural quantity of that business
divided among them all may afford too small a share
for each, and occasion complaints, that trading is dead;
these may also suppose, that it is owing to scarcity of
money, while, in fact, it is not so much from the fewness
of buyers, as from the excessive number of sellers,
that the mischief arises; and, if every shopkeeping farmer
and mechanic would return to the use of his plough
and working tools, there would remain of widows, and
other women, shopkeepers sufficient for the business,
which might then afford them a comfortable maintenance.</p>

<p>Whoever has travelled through the various parts of
Europe, and observed how small is the proportion of
people in affluence or easy circumstances there, compared
with those in poverty and misery; the few rich
and haughty landlords, the multitude of poor, abject,
rack-rented, tythe-paying tenants, and half-paid and
half-starved ragged labourers; and views here the happy
mediocrity, that so generally prevails throughout these
states, where the cultivator works for himself, and supports
his family in decent plenty, will, methinks, see
abundant reason to bless Divine Providence for the
evident and great difference in our favour, and be convinced,
that no nation known to us enjoys a greater
share of human felicity.</p>

<p>It is true, that in some of the states there are parties
and discords; but let us look back, and ask if we were
ever without them? Such will exist wherever there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
liberty; and perhaps they help to preserve it. By the
collision of different sentiments, sparks of truth are
struck out, and political light is obtained. The different
factions, which at present divide us, aim all at the
public good: the differences are only about the various
modes of promoting it. Things, actions, measures,
and objects of all kinds, present themselves to the minds
of men in such a variety of lights, that it is not possible
we should all think alike at the same time on every subject,
when hardly the same man retains at all times the
same ideas of it. Parties are therefore the common lot
of humanity; and ours are by no means more mischievous
or less beneficial than those of other countries, nations,
and ages, enjoying in the same degree the great
blessing of political liberty.</p>

<p>Some indeed among us are not so much grieved for
the present state of our affairs, as apprehensive for the
future. The growth of luxury alarms them, and they
think we are from that alone in the high road to ruin.
They observe, that no revenue is sufficient without economy,
and that the most plentiful income of a whole
people from the natural productions of their country
may be dissipated in vain and needless expences, and
poverty be introduced in the place of affluence. This
may be possible. It however rarely happens: for there
seems to be in every nation a greater proportion of industry
and frugality, which tend to enrich, than of
idleness and prodigality, which occasion poverty; so
that upon the whole there is a continual accumulation.
Reflect what Spain, Gaul, Germany, and Britain
were in the time of the Romans, inhabited by people
little richer than our savages, and consider the wealth
they at present possess, in numerous well-built cities,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
improved farms, rich moveables, magazines stocked
with valuable manufactures, to say nothing of plate
jewels, and coined money; and all this, notwithstanding
their bad, wasteful, plundering governments, and their
mad destructive wars; and yet luxury and extravagant
living has never suffered much restraint in those countries.
Then consider the great proportion of industrious
frugal farmers inhabiting the interior parts of these
American states, and of whom the body of our nation
consists, and judge whether it is possible, that the luxury
of our sea-ports can be sufficient to ruin such a country.&mdash;If
the importation of foreign luxuries could ruin
a people, we should probably have been ruined long
ago; for the British nation claimed a right, and practised
it, of importing among us not only the superfluities
of their own production, but those of every nation
under heaven; we bought and consumed them, and yet
we flourished and grew rich. At present our independent
governments may do what we could not then do,
discourage by heavy duties, or prevent by heavy prohibitions,
such importations, and thereby grow richer;
if, indeed, which may admit of dispute, the desire of
adorning ourselves with fine clothes, possessing fine
furniture, with elegant houses, &amp;c. is not, by strongly
inciting to labour and industry, the occasion of producing
a greater value, than is consumed in the gratification
of that desire.</p>

<p>The agriculture and fisheries of the United States are
the great sources of our increasing wealth. He that
puts a seed into the earth is recompensed, perhaps, by
receiving forty out of it; and he who draws a fish out
of our water, draws up a piece of silver.</p>

<p>Let us (and there is no doubt but we shall) be attentive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
to these, and then the power of rivals, with all their
restraining and prohibiting acts, cannot much hurt us.
We are sons of the earth and seas, and, like Antæus in
the fable, if, in wrestling with a Hercules, we now and
then receive a fall, the touch of our parents will communicate
to us fresh strength and vigour to renew the
contest.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Information to those who would remove to America.</em></a></h3>

<p>Many persons in Europe having directly or by letters,
expressed to the writer of this, who is well acquainted
with North-America, their desire of transporting
and establishing themselves in that country; but
who appear to him to have formed, through ignorance,
mistaken ideas and expectations of what is to be obtained
there; he thinks it may be useful, and prevent
inconvenient, expensive, and fruitless removals
and voyages of improper persons, if he gives some
clearer and truer notions of that part of the world, than
appear to have hitherto prevailed.</p>

<p>He finds it is imagined by numbers, that the inhabitants
of North America are rich, capable of rewarding,
and disposed to reward, all sorts of ingenuity; that
they are at the same time ignorant of all the sciences,
and consequently, that strangers, possessing talents in
the belles-lettres, fine arts, &amp;c. must be highly esteemed,
and so well paid, as to become easily rich themselves;
that there are also abundance of profitable offices to be
disposed of, which the natives are not qualified to fill;
and that, having few persons of family among them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
strangers of birth must be greatly respected, and of
course easily obtain the best of those offices, which will
make all their fortunes: that the governments too, to
encourage emigrations from Europe, not only pay the
expence of personal transportation, but give lands gratis
to strangers, with negroes to work for them, utensils of
husbandry, and stocks of cattle. These are all wild
imaginations; and those who go to America with expectations
founded upon them will surely find themselves
disappointed.</p>

<p>The truth is, that though there are in that country
few people so miserable as the poor of Europe, there
are also very few that in Europe would be called rich;
it is rather a general happy mediocrity that prevails.
There are few great proprietors of the soil, and few
tenants; most people cultivate their own lands, or follow
some handicraft or merchandise; very few rich
enough to live idly upon their rents or incomes, or to
pay the high prices given in Europe for painting, statues,
architecture, and the other works of art, that are
more curious than useful. Hence the natural <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'genuises'">geniuses</ins>,
that have arisen in America with such talents, have uniformly
quitted that country for Europe, where they can
be more suitably rewarded. It is true, that letters
and mathematical knowledge are in esteem there, but
they are at the same time more common than is apprehended;
there being already existing nine colleges or
universities, viz. four in New England, and one in each
of the provinces of New York, New Jersey, Pensylvania,
Maryland, and Virginia, all furnished with
learned professors; besides a number of smaller academies:
these educate many of their youth in the languages,
and those sciences that qualify men for the pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>fessions
of divinity, law, or physic. Strangers indeed
are by no means excluded from exercising those professions;
and the quick increase of inhabitants every
where gives them a chance of employ, which they have
in common with the natives. Of civil offices, or employments,
there are few; no superfluous ones, as in
Europe; and it is a rule established in some of the
states, that no office should be so profitable as to make it
desirable. The thirty-sixth article of the constitution of
Pensylvania runs expressly in these words: "As every
freeman, to preserve his independence (if he has not a
sufficient estate) ought to have some profession, calling,
trade, or farm, whereby he may honestly subsist, there
can be no necessity for, nor use in, establishing offices
of profit; the usual effects of which are dependence
and servility, unbecoming freemen, in the possessors
and expectants; faction, contention, corruption, and
disorder among the people. Wherefore, whenever an
office, through increase of fees or otherwise, becomes
so profitable, as to occasion many to apply for it, the
profits ought to be lessened by the legislature."</p>

<p>These ideas prevailing more or less in all the United
States, it cannot be worth any man's while, who has a
means of living at home, to expatriate himself, in hopes
of obtaining a profitable civil office in America; and
as to military offices, they are at an end with the war,
the armies being disbanded. Much less is it adviseable
for a person to go thither, who has no other quality to
recommend him but his birth. In Europe it has indeed
its value; but it is a commodity that cannot be carried
to a worse market than to that of America, where people
do not enquire concerning a stranger, <em>What is he?</em>
but <em>What can he do?</em> If he has any useful art, he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
welcome; and if he exercises it, and behaves well, he
will be respected by all that know him; but a mere man
of quality, who on that account wants to live upon the
public by some office or salary, will be despised and
disregarded. The husbandman is in honour there, and
even the mechanic, because their employments are useful.
The people have a saying, that God Almighty is
himself a mechanic, the greatest in the universe; and
he is respected and admired more for the variety, ingenuity,
and utility of his handiworks, than for the antiquity
of his family. They are pleased with the observation
of a negro, and frequently mention it, that Boccarora
(meaning the white man) make de black man
workee, make de horse workee, make de ox workee,
make ebery ting workee; only de hog. He de hog,
no workee; he eat, he drink, he walk about, he go to
sleep when he please, he libb like a gentleman. According
to these opinions of the Americans, one of them
would think himself more obliged to a genealogist, who
could prove for him that his ancestors and relations for
ten generations had been ploughmen, smiths, carpenters,
turners, weavers, tanners, or even shoemakers, and
consequently that they were useful members of society;
than if he could only prove that they were gentlemen,
doing nothing of value, but living idly on the labour of
others, mere <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fruges consumere nati</i><a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>, and otherwise <em>good
for nothing</em>, till by their death their estates, like the carcase
of the negro's gentleman-hog, come to be <em>cut up</em>.</p>

<p>With regard to encouragements for strangers from
government, they are really only what are derived from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
good laws and liberty. Strangers are welcome, because
there is room enough for them all, and therefore the
old inhabitants are not jealous of them; the laws protect
them sufficiently, so that they have no need of the
patronage of great men; and every one will enjoy securely
the profits of his industry. But if he does not
bring a fortune with him, he must work and be industrious
to live. One or two years residence give him all
the rights of a citizen; but the government does not at
present, whatever it may have done in former times,
hire people to become settlers, by paying their passages,
giving land, negroes, utensils, stock, or any other
kind of emolument whatsoever. In short, America is
the land of labour, and by no means what the English
call Lubberland, and the French Pays de Cocagne,
where the streets are said to be paved with half-peck
loaves, the houses tiled with pancakes, and where the
fowls fly about ready roasted, crying, <em>Come eat me!</em></p>

<p>Who then are the kind of persons to whom an emigration
to America may be advantageous? And what
are the advantages they may reasonably expect?</p>

<p>Land being cheap in that country, from the vast
forests still void of inhabitants, and not likely to be occupied
in an age to come, insomuch that the propriety
of an hundred acres of fertile soil full of wood may be
obtained near the frontiers, in many places, for eight or
ten guineas, hearty young labouring men, who understand
the husbandry of corn and cattle, which is nearly
the same in that country as in Europe, may easily establish
themselves there. A little money saved of the
good wages they receive there, while they work for
others, enables them to buy the land and begin their
plantation, in which they are assisted by the good-will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
of their neighbours, and some credit. Multitudes of
poor people from England, Ireland, Scotland, and Germany,
have by this means in a few years become
wealthy farmers, who, in their own countries, where all
the lands are fully occupied, and the wages of labour
low, could never have emerged from the mean condition
wherein they were born.</p>

<p>From the salubrity of the air, the healthiness of the
climate, the plenty of good provisions, and the encouragement
to early marriages, by the certainty of subsistence
in cultivating the earth, the increase of inhabitants
by natural generation is very rapid in America,
and becomes still more so by the accession of strangers;
hence there is a continual demand for more artisans of
all the necessary and useful kinds, to supply those cultivators
of the earth with houses, and with furniture and
utensils of the grosser sorts, which cannot so well be
brought from Europe. Tolerably good workmen in any
of those mechanic arts are sure to find employ, and to
be well paid for their work, there being no restraints
preventing strangers from exercising any art they understand,
nor any permission necessary. If they are
poor, they begin first as servants or journeymen; and
if they are sober, industrious, and frugal, they soon become
masters, establish themselves in business, marry,
raise families, and become respectable citizens.</p>

<p>Also, persons of moderate fortunes and capitals, who,
having a number of children to provide for, are desirous
of bringing them up to industry, and to secure estates
for their posterity, have opportunities of doing it in
America, which Europe does not afford. There they
may be taught and practise profitable mechanic arts,
without incurring disgrace on that account, but on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
contrary acquiring respect by such abilities. There
small capitals laid out in lands, which daily become
more valuable by the increase of people, afford a solid
prospect of ample fortunes thereafter for those children.
The writer of this has known several instances of large
tracts of land, bought, on what was then the frontier of
Pennsylvania, for ten pounds per hundred acres, which,
when the settlements had been extended far beyond them,
sold readily, without any improvement made upon them,
for three pounds per acre. The acre in America is the
same with the English acre, or the acre of Normandy.</p>

<p>Those, who desire to understand the state of government
in America, would do well to read the constitutions
of the several states, and the articles of confederation
that bind the whole together for general purposes,
under the direction of one assembly, called the congress.
These constitutions have been printed, by order
of congress, in America; two editions of them have also
been printed in London; and a good translation of
them into French has lately been published at Paris.</p>

<p>Several of the princes of Europe of late, from an
opinion of advantage to arise by producing all commodities
and manufactures within their own dominions,
so as to diminish or render useless their importations,
have endeavoured to entice workmen from other countries,
by high salaries, privileges, &amp;c. Many persons,
pretending to be skilled in various great manufactures,
imagining, that America must be in want of them, and
that the congress would probably be disposed to imitate
the princes above mentioned, have proposed to go
over, on condition of having their passages paid, lands
given, salaries appointed, exclusive privileges for terms
of years, &amp;c. Such persons, on reading the articles of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
confederation, will find, that the congress have no power
committed to them, or money put into their hands, for
such purposes; and that if any such encouragement is
given, it must be by the government of some separate
state. This, however, has rarely been done in
America; and when it has been done, it has rarely succeeded,
so as to establish a manufacture, which the
country was not yet so ripe for as to encourage private
persons to set it up; labour being generally too dear
there, and hands difficult to be kept together, every one
desiring to be a master, and the cheapness of land inclining
many to leave trades for agriculture. Some indeed
have met with success, and are carried on to advantage;
but they are generally such as require only a few
hands, or wherein great part of the work is performed
by machines. Goods that are bulky, and of so small
value as not well to bear the expence of freight, may
often be made cheaper in the country than they can
be imported; and the manufacture of such goods will
be profitable wherever there is a sufficient demand.
The farmers in America produce indeed a good deal of
wool and flax; and none is exported, it is all worked
up; but it is in the way of domestic manufacture, for
the use of the family. The buying up quantities of
wool and flax, with the design to employ spinners,
weavers, &amp;c. and form great establishments, producing
quantities of linen and woollen goods for sale, has been
several times attempted in different provinces; but
those projects have generally failed, goods of equal
value being imported cheaper. And when the governments
have been solicited to support such schemes by
encouragements, in money, or by imposing duties on
importation of such goods, it has been generally refused,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
on this principle, that if the country is ripe for
the manufacture, it may be carried on by private persons
to advantage; and if not, it is a folly to think of
forcing nature. Great establishments of manufacture
require great numbers of poor to do the work for small
wages; those poor are to be found in Europe, but will
not be found in America, till the lands are all taken up
and cultivated, and the excess of people, who cannot
get land, want employment. The manufacture of silk,
they say, is natural in France, as that of cloth in England,
because each country produces in plenty the first
material: but if England will have a manufacture of
silk as well as that of cloth, and France of cloth as well
as that of silk, these unnatural operations must be supported
by mutual prohibitions, or high duties on the
importation of each other's goods; by which means the
workmen are enabled to tax the home consumer by
greater prices, while the higher wages they receive
makes them neither happier nor richer, since they only
drink more and work less. Therefore the governments
in America do nothing to encourage such projects.
The people, by this means, are not imposed on either
by the merchant or mechanic: if the merchant demands
too much profit on imported shoes, they buy of
the shoe-maker; and if he asks too high a price, they
take them of the merchant: thus the two professions
are checks on each other. The shoemaker, however,
has, on the whole, a considerable profit upon his labour
in America, beyond what he had in Europe, as he can
add to his price a sum nearly equal to all the expences
of freight and commission, risque or insurance, &amp;c.
necessarily charged by the merchant. And the case
is the same with the workmen in every other mechanic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
art. Hence it is, that artisans generally live better and
more easily in America than in Europe; and such as
are good economists make a comfortable provision for
age, and for their children. Such may, therefore, remove
with advantage to America.</p>

<p>In the old long-settled countries of Europe, all arts,
trades, professions, farms, &amp;c. are so full, that it is difficult
for a poor man who has children to place them
where they may gain, or learn to gain, a decent livelihood.
The artisans, who fear creating future rivals in
business, refuse to take apprentices, but upon conditions
of money, maintenance, or the like, which the
parents are unable to comply with. Hence the youth
are dragged up in ignorance of every gainful art, and
obliged to become soldiers, or servants, or thieves, for
a subsistence. In America, the rapid increase of inhabitants
takes away that fear of rivalship, and artisans
willingly receive apprentices from the hope of profit by
their labour, during the remainder of the time stipulated,
after they shall be instructed. Hence it is easy for
poor families to get their children instructed; for the
artisans are so desirous of apprentices, that many of
them will even give money to the parents, to have boys
from ten to fifteen years of age bound apprentices to
them, till the age of twenty-one; and many poor parents
have, by that means, on their arrival in the country,
raised money enough to buy land sufficient to establish
themselves, and to subsist the rest of their family
by agriculture. These contracts for apprentices are
made before a magistrate, who regulates the agreement
according to reason and justice, and, having in view
the formation of a future useful citizen, obliges the
master to engage by a written indenture, not only that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
during the time of service stipulated, the apprentice
shall be duly provided with meat, drink, apparel, washing,
and lodging, and at its expiration with a complete
new suit of clothes, but also, that he shall be taught to
read, write, and cast accounts; and that he shall be
well instructed in the art or profession of his master, or
some other, by which he may afterwards gain a livelihood,
and be able in his turn to raise a family. A copy
of this indenture is given to the apprentice or his
friends, and the magistrate keeps a record of it, to
which recourse may be had, in case of failure by the
master in any point of performance. This desire among
the masters, to have more hands employed in working
for them, induces them to pay the passages of young
persons, of both sexes, who, on their arrival, agree to
serve them one, two, three, or four years; those who
have already learned a trade, agreeing for a shorter term,
in proportion to their skill, and the consequent
immediate value of their service; and those who have
none, agreeing for a longer term, in consideration of
being taught an art their poverty would not permit
them to acquire in their own country.</p>

<p>The almost general mediocrity of fortune that prevails
in America, obliging its people to follow some
business for subsistence, those vices, that arise usually
from idleness, are in a great measure prevented. Industry
and constant employment are great preservatives
of the morals and virtue of a nation. Hence bad
examples to youth are more rare in America, which
must be a comfortable consideration to parents. To
this may be truly added, that serious religion, under its
various denominations, is not only tolerated, but respected
and practised. Atheism is unknown there; infidelity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
rare and secret; so that persons may live to a
great age in that country, without having their piety
shocked by meeting with either an atheist or an infidel.
And the Divine Being seems to have manifested his
approbation of the mutual forbearance and kindness
with which the different sects treat each other, by the
remarkable prosperity with which he has been pleased
to favour the whole country.</p>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Passy, March 17, 1783.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">My Lord,</p>

<p>I received the letter your lordship did me the
honour of writing to me the 18th past, and am much
obliged by your kind congratulations on the return of
peace, which I hope will be lasting.</p>

<p>With regard to the terms on which lands may be
acquired in America, and the manner of beginning new
settlements on them, I cannot give better information
than may be found in a book lately printed at London,
under some such title as&mdash;<cite>Letters from a Pensylvanian
Farmer</cite>, by Hector St. John. The only encouragement
we hold out to strangers are, <em>a good climate, fertile soil,
wholesome air and water, plenty of provisions and food,
good pay for labour, kind neighbours, good laws, and a
hearty welcome</em>. The rest depends on a man's own industry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
and virtue. Lands are cheap, but they must be
bought. All settlements are undertaken at private expence;
the public contributes nothing but defence and
justice. I have long observed of your people, that
their sobriety, frugality, industry and honesty, seldom
fail of success in America, and of procuring them a
good establishment among us.</p>

<p>I do not recollect the circumstance you are pleased
to mention, of my having saved a citizen at St. Andrew's
by giving a turn to his disorder; and I am
curious to know, what the disorder was, and what the
advice I gave, that proved so salutary<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>. With great
regard I have the honour to be, my lord, your lordship's
most obedient and most humble servant,</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>A Comparison of the Conduct of the Ancient Jews, and of the
Antifederalists in the United States of America.</em></a><a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></h3>

<p>A zealous advocate for the proposed federal
constitution in a certain public assembly said, that
"the repugnance of a great part of mankind to good
government was such, that he believed, that if an angel
from heaven was to bring down a constitution, formed
there for our use, it would nevertheless meet with violent
opposition." He was reproved for the supposed
extravagance of the sentiment, and he did not justify
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
it. Probably it might not have immediately occurred
to him, that the experiment had been tried, and that
the event was recorded in the most faithful of all histories,
the Holy Bible; otherwise he might, as it seems to
me, have supported his opinion by that unexceptionable
authority.</p>

<p>The Supreme Being had been pleased to nourish up
a single family, by continued acts of his attentive providence,
till it became a great people: and having rescued
them from bondage by many miracles, performed
by his servant Moses, he personally delivered to that
chosen servant, in presence of the whole nation, a constitution
and code of laws for their observance, accompanied
and sanctioned with promises of great rewards,
and threats of severe punishments, as the consequence
of their obedience or disobedience.</p>

<p>This constitution, though the Deity himself was to
be at its head (and it is therefore called by political writers
a theocracy) could not be carried into execution
but by the means of his ministers; Aaron and his sons
were therefore commissioned to be, with Moses, the
first established ministry of the new government.</p>

<p>One would have thought, that the appointment of
men, who had distinguished themselves in procuring the
liberty of their nation, and had hazarded their lives in
openly opposing the will of a powerful monarch, who
would have retained that nation in slavery, might have
been an appointment acceptable to a grateful people;
and that a constitution, framed for them by the Deity
himself, might on that account have been secure of an
universal welcome reception. Yet there were, in every
one of the thirteen tribes, some discontented, restless
spirits, who were continually exciting them to reject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
the proposed new government, and this from various
motives.</p>

<p>Many still retained an affection for Egypt, the land of
their nativity, and these, whenever they felt any inconvenience
or hardship, though the natural and unavoidable
effect of their change of situation, exclaimed against
their leaders as the authors of their trouble: and were
not only for returning into Egypt, but for stoning their
deliverers<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>. Those inclined to idolatry were displeased
that their golden calf was destroyed. Many of the
chiefs thought the new constitution might be injurious
to their particular interests, that the profitable places
would be <em>engrossed by the families and friends of Moses
and Aaron</em>, and others, equally well born, excluded.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>&mdash;In
Josephus, and the Talmud, we learn some particulars,
not so fully narrated in the scripture. We are
there told, that Corah was ambitious of the priesthood,
and offended that it was conferred on Aaron;
and this, as he said, by the authority of Moses only,
<em>without the consent of the people</em>. He accused Moses of
having, by various artifices, fraudulently obtained the
government, and deprived the people of their liberties,
and of conspiring with Aaron to perpetuate the tyranny
in their family. Thus, though Corah's real motive was
the supplanting of Aaron, he persuaded the people, that
he meant only the public good; and they, moved by
his insinuations, began to cry out, "Let us maintain the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
common liberty of our <em>respective tribes</em>; we have freed
ourselves from the slavery imposed upon us by the
Egyptians, and shall we suffer ourselves to be made
slaves by Moses? If we must have a master, it were
better to return to Pharaoh, who at least fed us with
bread and onions, than to serve this new tyrant, who,
by his operations, has brought us into danger of famine."
Then they called in question the <em>reality of his conference</em>
with God, and objected to the privacy of the
meetings, and the preventing any of the people from
being present at the colloquies, or even approaching
the place, as grounds of great suspicion. They accused
Moses also of <em>peculation</em>, as embezzling part of the
golden spoons and the silver chargers, that the princes
had offered at the dedication of the altar<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>, and the
offerings of gold by the common people<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>, as well as
most of the poll tax<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>; and Aaron they accused of pocketing
much of the gold of which he pretended to have
made a molten calf. Besides peculation, they charged
Moses with <em>ambition</em>; to gratify which passion, he had,
they said, deceived the people, by promising to bring
them to a land flowing with milk and honey; instead
of doing which, he had brought them <em>from</em> such a land;
and that he thought light of all this mischief, provided
he could make himself an <em>absolute prince</em><a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>. That, to
support the new dignity with splendour in his family,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
the partial poll tax, already levied and given to Aaron<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>,
was to be followed by a general one<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>, which would
probably be augmented from time to time, if he were
suffered to go on promulgating new laws, on pretence
of new occasional revelations of the divine will, till
their whole fortunes were devoured by that aristocracy.</p>

<p>Moses denied the charge of peculation, and his accusers
were destitute of proofs to support it; though
<em>facts</em>, if real, are in their nature capable of proof. "I
have not," said he (with holy confidence in the presence
of God), "I have not taken from this people the
value of an ass, nor done them any other injury." But
his enemies had made the charge, and with some success
among the populace; for no kind of accusation is
so readily made, or easily believed, by knaves, as the
accusation of knavery.</p>

<p>In fine, no less than two hundred and fifty of the
principal men "famous in the congregation, men of
renown<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>," heading and exciting the mob, worked them
up to such a pitch of phrenzy, that they called out,
stone 'em, stone 'em, and thereby secure our liberties;
and let us choose other captains, that may lead us back
into Egypt, in case we do not succeed in reducing the
Canaanites.</p>

<p>On the whole, it appears, that the Israelites were a
people jealous of their newly acquired liberty, which
jealousy was in itself no fault; but that, when they suffered
it to be worked upon by artful men, pretending
public good, with nothing really in view but private
interest, they were led to oppose the establishment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
the new constitution, whereby they brought upon themselves
much inconvenience and misfortune. It farther
appears, from the same inestimable history, that when,
after many ages, the constitution had become old and
much abused, and an amendment of it was proposed,
the populace, as they had accused Moses of the ambition
of making himself a prince, and cried out, stone
him, stone him; so, excited by their high-priests and
scribes, they exclaimed against the Messiah, that he
aimed at becoming king of the Jews, and cried, crucify
him, crucify him. From all which we may gather,
that popular opposition to a public measure is no proof
of its impropriety, even though the opposition be excited
and headed by men of distinction.</p>

<p>To conclude, I beg I may not be understood to infer,
that our general convention was divinely inspired when
it formed the new federal constitution, merely because
that constitution has been unreasonably and vehemently
opposed: yet, I must own, I have so much
faith in the general government of the world by Providence,
that I can hardly conceive a transaction of such
momentous importance to the welfare of millions now
existing, and to exist in the posterity of a great nation,
should be suffered to pass without being in some degree
influenced, guided and governed by that omnipotent,
omnipresent and beneficent ruler, in whom all inferior
spirits live, and move, and have their being.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Final Speech of Dr. Franklin in the late Federal Convention.</em></a><a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></h3>

<p class="smcap pad2">Mr. President,</p>

<p>I confess that I do not entirely approve of this
constitution at present: but, Sir, I am not sure I shall
never approve it; for having lived long, I have experienced
many instances of being obliged, by better information,
or fuller consideration, to change opinions,
even on important subjects, which I once thought
right, but found to be otherwise. It is, therefore, that,
the older I grow, the more apt I am to doubt my own
judgment, and to pay more respect to the judgment of
others. Most men, indeed, as well as most sects in
religion, think themselves in possession of all truth,
and that whenever others differ from them, it is so far
error. Steel, a protestant, in a dedication, tells the
pope, that "the only difference between our two
churches, in their opinions of the certainty of their
doctrines is, the Romish church is infallible, and the
church of England never in the wrong." But, though
many private persons think almost as highly of their
own infallibility as of that of their sect, few express it
so naturally as a certain French lady, who, in a little
dispute with her sister, said, I don't know how it happens,
sister, but I meet with nobody but myself that is
always in the right. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il n'y a que moi qui a toujours
raison.</i> In these sentiments, Sir, I agree to this constitution,
with all its faults, if they are such, because I
think a general government necessary for us, and there
is no form of government but what may be a blessing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
if well administered; and I believe farther, that this is
likely to be well administered for a course of years, and
can only end in despotism, as other forms have done
before it, when the people shall become so corrupted as
to need despotic government, being incapable of any
other. I doubt too, whether any other convention we
can obtain, may be able to make a better constitution.
For when you assemble a number of men, to have the
advantage of their joint wisdom, you inevitably assemble
with those men, all their prejudices, their passions,
their errors of opinion, their local interests, and their
selfish views. From such an assembly can a perfect
production be expected? It therefore astonishes me,
sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection
as it does; and I think it will astonish our enemies,
who are waiting with confidence to hear, that our councils
are confounded, like those of the builders of Babylon,
and that our states are on the point of separation,
only to meet hereafter for the purpose of cutting each
other's throats.</p>

<p>Thus I consent, sir, to this constitution, because I
expect no better, and because I am not sure, that this is
not the best. The opinions I have had of its errors, I
sacrifice to the public good. I have never whispered a
syllable of them abroad. Within these walls they were
born, and here they shall die. If every one of us, in
returning to our constituents, were to report the objections
he has had to it, and endeavour to gain partisans
in support of them, we might prevent its being generally
received, and thereby lose all the salutary effects
and great advantages resulting naturally in our favour
among foreign nations, as well as among ourselves,
from our real or apparent unanimity. Much of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
strength and efficiency of any government, in procuring
and securing happiness to the people, depends on
opinion, on the general opinion of the goodness of that
government, as well as of the wisdom and integrity of
its governors.</p>

<p>I hope therefore, that for our own sakes, as part of
the people, and for the sake of our posterity, we shall
act heartily and unanimously in recommending this
constitution, wherever our influence may extend, and
turn our future thoughts and endeavours to the means
of having it well administered.</p>

<p>On the whole, sir, I cannot help expressing a wish,
that every member of the convention, who may still
have objections, would with me, on this occasion, doubt
a little of his own infallibility, and, to make manifest
our unanimity, put his name to this instrument.</p>

<p>[The motion was then made for adding the last formula,
viz.</p>

<p>Done in Convention, by the unanimous consent, &amp;c.
which was agreed to, and added accordingly.]</p>

<p class="pfs70">FROM THE AMERICAN WEEKLY MERCURY, FROM TUESDAY, JANUARY
28, TO TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1728,&mdash;9.</p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Mr. Andrew Bradford,</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="drcap">I</span> design this to acquaint you, that I, who have
long been one of your courteous readers, have lately
entertained some thought of setting up for an author
myself; not out of the least vanity, I assure you, or desire
of showing my parts, but purely for the good of my
country.</p>

<p>I have often observed with concern, that your Mercury
is not always equally entertaining. The delay of
ships expected in, and want of fresh advices from Europe,
make it frequently very dull; and I find the freezing
of our river has the same effect on news as trade.&mdash;With
more concern have I continually observed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
growing vices and follies of my country folk: and
though reformation is properly the concern of every
man, that is, every one ought to mend one; yet it is
too true in this case, that what is every body's business
is no body's business, and the business is done accordingly.
I therefore, upon mature deliberation, think fit
to take no body's business wholly into my own hands;
and, out of zeal for the public good, design to erect
myself into a kind of censor morum; purposing, with
your allowance, to make use of the Weekly Mercury
as a vehicle, in which my remonstrances shall be conveyed
to the world.</p>

<p>I am sensible I have, in this particular, undertaken a
very unthankful office, and expect little besides my
labour for my pains. Nay, it is probable, I may displease
a great number of your readers, who will not very
well like to pay ten shillings a year for being told of
their faults. But as most people delight in censure,
when they themselves are not the objects of it, if any
are offended at my publicly exposing their private
vices, I promise they shall have the satisfaction, in a
very little time, of seeing their good friends and neighbours
in the same circumstances.</p>

<p>However, let the fair sex be assured, that I shall
always treat them and their affairs with the utmost decency
and respect. I intend now and then to dedicate
a chapter wholly to their service; and if my lectures
any way contribute to the embellishment of their minds,
and brightening of their understandings, without offending
their modesty, I doubt not of having their favour
and encouragement.</p>

<p>It is certain, that no country in the world produces
naturally finer spirits than ours, men of genius for every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
kind of science, and capable of acquiring to perfection
every qualification, that is in esteem among mankind.
But as few here have the advantage of good books, for
want of which, good conversation is still more scarce,
it would, doubtless, have been very acceptable to your
readers, if, instead of an old out-of-date article from
Muscovy or Hungary, you had entertained them with
some well chosen extract from a good author. This I
shall sometimes do, when I happen to have nothing of
my own to say that I think of more consequence.
Sometimes, I purpose to deliver lectures of morality of
philosophy, and (because I am naturally inclined to be
meddling with things that do not concern me) perhaps
I may sometimes talk politics. And if I can by any
means furnish out a weekly entertainment for the public,
that will give a rational diversion, and at the same time
be instructive to the readers, I shall think my leisure
hours well employed: and if you publish this, I hereby
invite all ingenious gentlemen and others (that approve
of such an undertaking) to my assistance and correspondence.</p>

<p>It is like, by this time, you have a curiosity to be acquainted
with my name and character. As I do not aim
at public praise, I design to remain concealed: and
there are such numbers of our family and relations at
this time in the country, that, though I have signed my
name at full length, I am not under the least apprehension
of being distinguished and discovered by it. My
character indeed, I would favour you with, but that I
am cautious of praising myself, lest I should be told
my trumpeter's dead: and I cannot find in my heart,
at present, to say any thing to my own disadvantage.</p>

<p>It is very common with authors in their first performances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
to talk to their readers thus, If this meets
with a suitable reception, or, if this should meet with
due encouragement, I shall hereafter publish, &amp;c.&mdash;This
only manifests the value they put on their own
writings, since they think to frighten the public into
their applause, by threatening, that unless you approve
what they have already wrote, they intend never to
write again; when perhaps it may not be a pin matter,
whether they ever do or no. As I have not observ'd
the critics to be more favourable on this account, I
shall always avoid saying any thing of the kind; and
conclude with telling you, that if you send me a bottle
of ink and a quire of paper by the bearer, you may depend
on hearing further from,</p>

<p class="verse">And fain would be upon the laughing side.&mdash;<span class="xxs lsp2">POPE.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>Monsieur Rochefocault tells us somewhere in his
Memoirs, that the Prince of Condé delighted much in
ridicule, and used frequently to shut himself up for half
a day together, in his chamber, with a gentleman, that
was his favourite, purposely to divert himself with examining
what was the foible, or ridiculous side, of every
noted person in the court. That gentleman said afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
in some company, that he thought nothing was
more ridiculous in any body, than this same humour in
the prince; and I am somewhat inclined to be of this
opinion. The general tendency there is among us to
this embellishment (which I fear has too often grossly
imposed upon my loving countrymen instead of wit)
and the applause it meets with from a rising generation,
fill me with fearful apprehensions for the future reputation
of my country: a young man of modesty (which is the
most certain indication of large capacities) is hereby
discouraged from attempting to make any figure in life:
his apprehensions of being outlaughed, will force him
to continue in a restless obscurity, without having an
opportunity of knowing his own merit himself, or discovering
it to the world, rather than venture to expose
himself in a place, where a pun or a sneer shall pass for
wit, noise for reason, and the strength of the argument
be judged by that of the lungs. Among these witty
gentlemen let us take a view of Ridentius: what a contemptible
figure does he make with his train of paltry
admirers? This wight shall give himself an hour's diversion
with the cock of a man's hat, the heels of his shoes,
an unguarded expression in his discourse, or even some
personal defect; and the height of his low ambition is
to put some one of the company to the blush, who perhaps
must pay an equal share of the reckoning with himself.
If such a fellow makes laughing the sole end and purpose
of his life, if it is necessary to his constitution, or
if he has a great desire of growing suddenly fat, let him
eat; let him give public notice where any dull stupid
rogues may get a quart of four-penny for being laugh'd
at; but it is barbarously unhandsome, when friends meet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
for the benefit of conversation, and a proper relaxation
from business, that one should be the butt of the company,
and four men made merry at the cost of the fifth.</p>

<p>How different from this character is that of the good-natured,
gay Eugenius? who never spoke yet but with
a design to divert and please; and who was never yet
baulked in his intention. Eugenius takes more delight
in applying the wit of his friends, than in being admired
himself: and if any one of the company is so unfortunate
as to be touched a little too nearly, he will make
use of some ingenious artifice to turn the edge of ridicule
another way, chusing rather to make himself a
public jest, than be at the pain of seeing his friend in
confusion.</p>

<p>Among the tribe of laughers I reckon the pretty gentlemen,
that write satyrs, and carry them about in their
pockets, reading them themselves in all company they
happen into; taking an advantage of the ill taste of the
town, to make themselves famous for a pack of paltry,
low nonsense, for which they deserve to be kicked,
rather than admired, by all who have the least tincture
of politeness. These I take to be the most incorrigible
of all my readers; nay, I expect they will be squibbing
at the Busy-Body himself. However, the only
favour he begs of them is this, that if they cannot controul
their overbearing itch of scribbling, let him be
attacked in downright biting lyricks; for there is no
satyr he dreads half so much, as an attempt towards a
panegyrick.</p>

<p>It is said, that the Persians, in their ancient constitution,
had public schools, in which virtue was taught as
a liberal art or science: and it is certainly of more consequence
to a man, that he has learnt to govern his passions;
in spite of temptation, to be just in his dealings,
to be temperate in his pleasures, to support himself with
fortitude under his misfortunes, to behave with prudence
in all his affairs, and in every circumstance of
life; I say, it is of much more real advantage to him to
be thus qualified, than to be a master of all the arts and
sciences in the world beside.</p>

<p>Virtue alone is sufficient to make a man great, glorious,
and happy.&mdash;He that is acquainted with Cato, as
I am, cannot help thinking as I do now, and will acknowledge
he deserves the name, without being honoured
by it. Cato is a man whom fortune has placed
in the most obscure part of the country. His circumstances
are such, as only put him above necessity, without
affording him many superfluities: yet who is greater
than Cato? I happened but the other day to be at a
house in town, where, among others, were met, men of
the most note in this place; Cato had business with
some of them, and knocked at the door. The most
trifling actions of a man, in my opinion, as well as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
smallest features and lineaments of the face, give a nice
observer some notion of his mind. Methought he
rapped in such a peculiar manner, as seemed of itself to
express there was one who deserved as well as desired
admission. He appeared in the plainest country garb;
his great coat was coarse, and looked old and thread
bare; his linen was homespun; his beard, perhaps, of
seven days growth; his shoes thick and heavy; and
every part of his dress corresponding. Why was this
man received with such concurring respect from every
person in the room, even from those, who had never
known him or seen him before? It was not an exquisite
form of person or grandeur of dress, that struck us with
admiration. I believe long habits of virtue have a sensible
effect on the countenance: there was something
in the air of his face, that manifested the true
greatness of his mind; which likewise appeared in all he
said, and in every part of his behaviour, obliging us to
regard him with a kind of veneration. His aspect is
sweetened with humanity and benevolence, and at the
same time emboldened with resolution, equally free
from diffident bashfulness and an unbecoming assurance.
The consciousness of his own innate worth and
unshaken integrity renders him calm and undaunted
in the presence of the most great and powerful, and
upon the most extraordinary occasions. His strict
justice and known impartiality make him the arbitrator
and decider of all differences, that arise for many miles
around him, without putting his neighbours to the charge,
perplexity, and uncertainty of law-suits. He always
speaks the thing he means, which he is never afraid or
ashamed to do, because he knows he always means well;
and therefore is never obliged to blush, and feel the confusion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
of finding himself detected in the meanness of a
falshood. He never contrives ill against his neighbour,
and therefore is never seen with a lowring, suspicious
aspect. A mixture of innocence and wisdom makes
him ever seriously chearful. His generous hospitality
to strangers, according to his ability, his goodness, his
charity, his courage in the cause of the oppressed, his
fidelity in friendship, his humility, his honesty and sincerity,
his moderation and his loyalty to the government,
his piety, his temperance, his love to mankind,
his magnanimity, his public spiritedness, and, in fine,
his consummate virtue, make him justly deserve to be
esteemed the glory of his country.</p>

<p>Who would not rather choose, if it were in his choice,
to merit the above character, than be the richest, the
most learned, or the most powerful man in the province
without it?</p>

<p>Almost every man has a strong natural desire of being
valued and esteemed by the rest of his species; but I am
concerned and grieved to see how few fall into the right
and only infallible method of becoming so. That laudable
ambition is too commonly misapply'd and often ill
employed. Some, to make themselves considerable,
pursue learning; others grasp at wealth; some aim at
being thought witty; and others are only careful to
make the most of an handsome person: but what is
wit, or wealth, or form, or learning, when compared
with virtue? It is true, we love the handsome, we applaud
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
the learned, and we fear the rich and powerful;
but we even worship and adore the virtuous. Nor is it
strange; since men of virtue are so rare, so very rare to
be found. If we were as industrious to become good,
as to make ourselves great, we should become really
great by being good, and the number of valuable men
would be much increased; but it is a grand mistake to
think of being great without goodness; and I pronounce
it as certain, that there was never yet a truly great man,
that was not at the same time truly virtuous.</p>

<p>O Cretico! thou sour philosopher! thou cunning
statesman! thou art crafty, but far from being wise.
When wilt thou be esteemed, regarded, and beloved like
Cato? When wilt thou, among thy creatures, meet with
that unfeigned respect and warm good-will that all men
have for him? Wilt thou never understand, that the
cringing, mean, submissive deportment of thy dependants,
is (like the worship paid by Indians to the devil)
rather through fear of the harm thou mayst do them,
than out of gratitude for the favours they have received
of thee? Thou art not wholly void of virtue; there are
many good things in thee, and many good actions reported
of thee. Be advised by thy friend: neglect those
musty authors; let them be covered with dust, and
moulder on their proper shelves; and do thou apply
thyself to a study much more profitable, the knowledge
of mankind and of thyself.</p>

<p>In my first paper, I invited the learned and the ingenious
to join with me in this undertaking; and I now repeat
that invitation. I would have such gentlemen take this
opportunity (by trying their talent in writing) of diverting
themselves and friends, and improving the
taste of the town. And because I would encourage all
wit of our own growth and produce, I hereby promise,
that whoever shall send me a little essay on some moral
or other subject, that is fit for public view in this manner,
(and not basely borrowed from any other author) I
shall receive it with candour, and take care to place it
to the best advantage. It will be hard, if we cannot
muster up in the whole country a sufficient stock of
sense to supply the Busy-Body at least for a twelve-month.
For my own part, I have already professed,
that I have the good of my country wholly at heart in
this design, without the least sinister view; my chief
purpose being to inculcate the noble principles of virtue,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
and depreciate vice of every kind. But as I know
the mob hate instruction, and the generality would never
read beyond the first line of my lectures, if they
were actually filled with nothing but wholesome precepts
and advice, I must therefore sometimes humour
them in their own way. There are a set of great names
in the province, who are the common objects of popular
dislike. If I can now and then overcome my reluctance,
and prevail with myself to satirize a little, one of
these gentlemen, the expectation of meeting with such
a gratification will induce many to read me through,
who would otherwise proceed immediately to the foreign
news. As I am very well assured the greatest
men among us have a sincere love for their country,
notwithstanding its ingratitude, and the insinuations of
the envious and malicious to the contrary, so I doubt
not but they will cheerfully tolerate me in the liberty I
design to take for the end abovementioned.</p>

<p>As yet I have but few correspondents, though they
begin now to increase. The following letter, left for
me at the printer's, is one of the first I have received,
which I regard the more for that it comes from one of
the fair sex, and because I have myself oftentimes suffered
under the grievance therein complained of.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="center"><em>To the Busy-Body.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>You having set yourself up for a censuror morum
(as I think you call it) which is said to mean a reformer
of manners, I know no person more proper to be applied
to for redress in all the grievances we suffer from
want of manners in some people. You must know, I
am a single woman, and keep a shop in this town for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
livelihood. There is a certain neighbour of mine, who
is really agreeable company enough, and with whom I
have had an intimacy of some time standing; but of
late she makes her visits so exceedingly often, and stays
so very long every visit, that I am tired out of all patience.
I have no manner of time at all to myself;
and you, who seem to be a wise man, must needs be
sensible, that every person has little secrets and privacies,
that are not proper to be exposed even to the nearest
friend. Now I cannot do the least thing in the world,
but she must know about it; and it is a wonder I have
found an opportunity to write you this letter. My misfortune
is, that I respect her very well, and know not
how to disoblige her so much as to tell her, I should be
glad to have less of her company; for if I should once
hint such a thing, I am afraid she would resent it so as
never to darken my door again.&mdash;But alas, Sir, I have
not yet told you half my affliction. She has two children
that are just big enough to run about and do pretty
mischief: these are continually along with mamma,
either in my room or shop, if I have ever so many customers
or people with me about business. Sometimes
they pull the goods off my low shelves down to the
ground, and perhaps where one of them has just been
making water. My friend takes up the stuff, and cries,
"Oh! thou little wicked mischievous rogue!" But however,
it has done no great damage; it is only wet a little,
and so puts it up upon the shelf again. Sometimes
they get to my cask of nails behind the counter, and
divert themselves, to my great vexation, with mixing
my ten-penny and eight-penny and four-penny together.
I endeavour to conceal my uneasiness as much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
as possible, and with a grave look go to sorting them
out. She cries, "Don't thee trouble thyself, neighbour.
Let them play a little; I'll put all to rights before
I go." But things are never so put to rights but
that I find a great deal of work to do after they are
gone. Thus, Sir, I have all the trouble and pesterment
of children, without the pleasure of calling them my
own; and they are now so used to being here that they
will be content no where else. If she would have been
so kind as to have moderated her visits to ten times a
day, and staid but half an hour at a time, I should have
been contented, and I believe never have given you
this trouble. But this very morning they have so tormented
me that I could bear no longer; for while the
mother was asking me twenty impertinent questions,
the youngest got to my nails, and with great delight
rattled them by handfuls all over the floor; and the
other at the same time made such a terrible din upon
my counter with a hammer, that I grew half distracted.
I was just then about to make myself a new suit of
pinners, but in the fret and confusion I cut it quite out
of all manner of shape, and utterly spoiled a piece of
the first muslin. Pray, sir, tell me what I shall do.
And talk a little against such unreasonable visiting in
your next paper: though I would not have her affronted
with me for a great deal, for sincerely I love her and
her children, as well, I think, as a neighbour can, and
she buys a great many things in a year at my shop.
But I would beg her to consider, that she uses me unmercifully,
though I believe it is only for want of
thought. But I have twenty things more to tell you
besides all this: there is a handsome gentleman that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
has a mind (I don't question) to make love to me; but
he can't get the opportunity to&mdash;&mdash;O dear, here she
comes again; I must conclude</p>

<p class="right padr6">"Your's, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="right padr2">"PATIENCE."</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p>Indeed, it is well enough, as it happens, that she is
come to shorten this complaint, which I think is full
long enough already, and probably would otherwise
have been as long again. However, I must confess, I
cannot help pitying my correspondent's case, and in
her behalf, exhort the visitor to remember and consider
the words of the wise man, withdraw thy foot from the
house of thy neighbour, lest he grow weary of thee and
so hate thee. It is, I believe, a nice thing and very
difficult, to regulate our visits in such a manner, as never
to give offence by coming too seldom, or too often,
or departing too abruptly, or staying too long. However,
in my opinion, it is safest for most people, in a
general way, who are unwilling to disoblige, to visit
seldom, and tarry but a little while in a place; notwithstanding
pressing invitations, which are many times
insincere. And though more of your company should
be really desired; yet in this case, too much reservedness
is a fault more easily excused than the contrary.</p>

<p>Men are subject to various inconveniencies merely
through lack of a small share of courage, which is a
quality very necessary in the common occurrences of
life, as well as in a battle. How many impertinencies
do we daily suffer with great uneasiness, because we
have not courage enough to discover our dislike? And
why may not a man use the boldness and freedom of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
telling his friends, that their long visits sometimes incommode
him? On this occasion, it may be entertaining
to some of my readers, if I acquaint them with the
Turkish manner of entertaining visitors, which I have
from an author of unquestionable veracity; who assures
us, that even the Turks are not so ignorant of civility
and the arts of endearment, but that they can practise
them with as much exactness as any other nation,
whenever they have a mind to show themselves obliging.</p>

<p>"When you visit a person of quality (says he) and
have talked over your business, or the compliments, or
whatever concern brought you thither, he makes a sign
to have things served in for the entertainment, which
is generally a little sweetmeat, a dish of sherbet, and
another of coffee; all which are immediately brought
in by the servants, and tendered to all the guests in
order, with the greatest care and awfulness imaginable.
At last comes the finishing part of your entertainment,
which is, perfuming the beards of the company; a
ceremony which is performed in this manner. They
have for the purpose a small silver chaffing dish,
covered with a lid full of holes, and fixed upon a handsome
plate. In this they put some fresh coals, and
upon them a piece of lignum aloes, and shutting it up,
the smoke immediately ascends with a grateful odour
through the holes of the cover. This smoke is held
under every one's chin, and offered as it were a sacrifice
to his beard. The bristly idol soon receives the reverence
done to it, and so greedily takes in and incorporates
the gummy steam, that it retains the savour of it,
and may serve for a nosegay a good while after.</p>

<p>"This ceremony may perhaps seem ridiculous at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
first hearing; but it passes among the Turks for an
high gratification. And I will say this in its vindication,
that its design is very wise and useful. For it is
understood to give a civil dismission to the visitants,
intimating to them, that the master of the house has
business to do, or some other avocation, that permits
them to go away as soon as they please; and the sooner
after this ceremony the better. By this means you
may, at any time, without offence, deliver yourself
from being detained from your affairs by tedious and
unseasonable visits; and from being constrained to use
that piece of hypocrisy, so common in the world, of
pressing those to stay longer with you, whom perhaps
in your heart you wish a great way off for having troubled
you so long already."</p>

<p>Thus far my author. For my own part, I have
taken such a fancy to this Turkish custom, that for the
future I shall put something like it in practice. I have
provided a bottle of right French brandy for the men,
and citron water for the ladies. After I have treated
with a dram, and presented a pinch of my best snuff, I
expect all company will retire, and leave me to pursue
my studies for the good of the public.</p>

<p>This paper being design'd for a terror to evil doers,
as well as a praise to them that do well, I am lifted up
with secret joy to find, that my undertaking is approved,
and encourag'd by the just and good, and that
few are against me but those who have reason to
fear me.</p>

<p>There are little follies in the behaviour of most men,
which their best friends are too tender to acquaint them
with; there are little vices and small crimes which the
law has no regard to or remedy for: there are likewise
great pieces of villany sometimes so craftily accomplished,
and so circumspectly guarded, that the law can
take no hold of the actors. All these things, and all
things of this nature, come within my province as Censor,
and I am determined not to be negligent of the
trust I have reposed in myself, but resolve to execute
my office diligently and faithfully.</p>

<p>And that all the world may judge with how much
humanity, as well as justice, I shall behave in this
office; and that even my enemies may be convinced I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
take no delight to rake into the dunghill lives of vicious
men; and to the end that certain persons may be a little
eased of their fears, and relieved from the terrible palpitations
they have lately felt and suffered, and do still
suffer; I hereby graciously pass an act of general oblivion,
for all offences, crimes, and misdemeanors of
what kind soever, committed from the beginning of the
year 1681, until the day of the date of my first paper,
and promise only to concern myself with such as have
been since and shall hereafter be committed. I shall
take no notice who has (heretofore) raised a fortune by
fraud and oppression, nor who by deceit and hypocrisy;
what woman has been false to her good husband's bed,
nor what man has, by barbarous usage or neglect, broke
the heart of a faithful wife, and wasted his health and
substance in debauchery; what base wretch has betrayed
his friend, and sold his honesty for gold, nor
what baser wretch first corrupted him, and then bought
the bargain: all this, and much more of the same kind,
I shall forget, and pass over in silence; but then it is
to be observed, that I expect and require a sudden and
general amendment.</p>

<p>These threatenings of mine, I hope will have a good
effect, and, if regarded, may prevent abundance of folly
and wickedness in others, and, at the same time, save
me abundance of trouble: and that people may not
flatter themselves with the hopes of concealing their
loose misdemeanors from my knowledge, and in that view
persist in evil doing, I must acquaint them, that I have
lately entered into an intimacy with the extraordinary
person, who some time since wrote me the following
letter; and who, having a wonderful faculty, that enables
him to discover the most secret iniquity, is capable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
of giving me great assistance in my designed work of
reformation.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="smcap pad2">"Mr. Busy-Body,</p>

<p>"I rejoice, sir, at the opportunity you have given
me to be serviceable to you, and, by your means, to this
province. You must know, that such have been the
circumstances of my life, and such were the marvellous
concurrences of my birth, that I have not only a faculty
of discovering the actions of persons, that are absent or
asleep, but even of the devil himself, in many of his
secret workings, in the various shapes, habits, and
names of men and women: and having travelled and
conversed much, and met but with a very few of the
same perceptions and qualifications, I can recommend
myself to you as the most useful man you can correspond
with. My father's father's father (for we had no
grandfathers in our family) was the same John Bunyan
that writ that memorable book, The Pilgrim's Progress,
who had, in some degree, a natural faculty of second
sight. This faculty (how derived to him our family
memoirs are not very clear) was enjoyed by all his descendants,
but not by equal talents. It was very dim
in several of my first cousins, and probably had been
nearly extinct in our particular branch, had not my
father been a traveller. He lived, in his youthful
days, in New England. There he married, and there
was born my elder brother, who had so much of this
faculty, as to discover witches in some of their occult
performances. My parents transporting themselves to
Great Britain, my second brother's birth was in that
kingdom. He shared but a small portion of this virtue,
being only able to discern transactions about the time of,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
and for the most part after, their happening. My good
father, who delighted in the Pilgrim's Progress, and
mountainous places, took shipping, with his wife, for
Scotland, and inhabited in the Highlands, where myself
was born; and whether the soil, climate, or astral influences,
of which are preserved divers prognosticks,
restored our ancestor's natural faculty of second sight,
in a greater lustre to me, than it had shined in through
several generations, I will not here discuss. But so it
is, that I am possessed largely of it, and design, if you
encourage the proposal, to take this opportunity of
doing good with it, which I question not will be accepted
of in a grateful way by many of your honest
readers, though the discovery of my extraction bodes
me no deference from your great scholars and modern
philosophers. This my father was long ago aware of,
and lest the name alone should hurt the fortunes of his
children, he, in his shiftings from one country to another,
wisely changed it.</p>

<p>"Sir, I have only this further to say, how I may be
useful to you, and as a reason for my not making myself
more known in the world: by virtue of this great
gift of nature, second-sightedness, I do continually see
numbers of men, women, and children, of all ranks, and
what they are doing, while I am sitting in my closet;
which is too great a burthen for the mind, and makes
me also conceit, even against reason, that all this host
of people can see and observe me, which strongly inclines
me to solitude, and an obscure living; and, on
the other hand, it will be an ease to me to disburthen
my thoughts and observations in the way proposed to
you, by sir, your friend and humble servant."</p>

<p>I conceal this correspondent's name, in my care for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
his life and safety, and cannot but approve his prudence,
in chusing to live obscurely. I remember the
fate of my poor monkey: he had an illnatured trick of
grinning and chattering at every thing he saw in peticoats:
my ignorant country neighbours got a notion,
that pug snarled by instinct at every female who had
lost her virginity. This was no sooner generally believed,
than he was condemned to death: by whom I
could never learn, but he was assassinated in the night,
barbarously stabbed and mangled in a thousand places,
and left hanging dead on one of my gate posts, where
I found him the next morning.</p>

<p>The Censor observing, that the itch of scribbling begins
to spread exceedingly, and being carefully tender
of the reputation of his country, in point of wit and
good sense, has determined to take all manner of writings
in verse or prose, that pretend to either, under his
immediate cognizance; and accordingly, hereby prohibits
the publishing any such for the future, till they
have first passed his examination, and received his imprimatur:
for which he demands as a fee only sixpence
per sheet.</p>

<p>N. B. He nevertheless permits to be published, all
satirical remarks on the Busy-Body, the above prohibition
notwithstanding, and without examination, or requiring
the said fees; which indulgence the small wits,
in and about this city, are advised gratefully to accept
and acknowledge.</p>

<p>The gentleman, who calls himself Sirronio, is directed,
on receipt of this, to burn his great book of
Crudities.</p>

<p>P. S. In compassion to that young man, on account
of the great pains he has taken, in consideration of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
character I have just received of him, that he is really
good natured, and on condition he shows it to no foreigner,
or stranger of sense, I have thought fit to reprieve
his said great book of Crudities from the flames,
till further order.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<p class="pfs80">Noli me tangere</p>

<p>I had resolved, when I first commenced this design,
on no account to enter into a public dispute with any
man; for I judged it would be equally unpleasant to me
and my readers, to see this paper filled with contentious
wrangling, answers, replies, &amp;c. which is a way of
writing that is endless, and, at the same time, seldom
contains any thing that is either edifying or entertaining.
Yet, when such a considerable man as Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
finds himself concerned so warmly to accuse and condemn
me, as he has done in Keimer's last Instructor, I
cannot forbear endeavouring to say something in my
own defence, from one of the worst of characters that
could be given me by a man of worth. But as I have
many things of more consequence to offer the public, I
declare, that I will never, after this time, take notice of
any accusations, not better supported with truth and
reason; much less may every little scribbler, that shall
attack me, expect an answer from the Busy-Body.</p>

<p>The sum of the charge delivered against me, either
directly or indirectly, in the said paper, is this: not to
mention the first weighty sentence concerning vanity
and ill-nature, and the shrewd intimation, that I am
without charity, and therefore can have no pretence to
religion, I am represented as guilty of defamation and
scandal, the odiousness of which is apparent to every
good man, and the practice of it opposite to christianity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
morality, and common justice, and, in some cases,
so far below all these, as to be inhuman; as a blaster
of reputations; as attempting, by a pretence, to screen
myself from the imputation of malice and prejudice; as
using a weapon, which the wiser and better part of mankind
hold in abhorrence; and as giving treatment which
the wiser and better part of mankind dislike on the
same principles, and for the same reason, as they do assassination,
&amp;c.; and all this is inferred and concluded
from a character I have wrote in my Number III.</p>

<p>In order to examine the justice and truth of this
heavy charge, let us recur to that character. And here
we may be surprized to find what a trifle has raised this
mighty clamour and complaint, this grievous accusation!&mdash;The
worst thing said of the person, in what is
called my gross description (be he who he will to whom
my accuser has applied the character of Cretico) is,
that he is a sour philosopher, crafty, but not wise. Few
humane characters can be drawn that will not fit some
body, in so large a country as this; but one would
think, supposing I meant Cretico a real person, I had
sufficiently manifested my impartiality, when I said, in
that very paragraph, that Cretico is not without virtue;
that there are many good things in him, and many good
actions reported of him; which must be allowed in all
reason, very much to overbalance in his favour those
worst words, sour tempered, and cunning. Nay, my
very enemy and accuser must have been sensible of this,
when he freely acknowledges, that he has been seriously
considering, and cannot yet determine, which he would
choose to be, the Cato or Cretico of that paper; since
my Cato is one of the best of characters. Thus much
in my own vindication. As to the only reasons there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
given, why I ought not to continue drawing characters,
viz. Why should any man's picture be published which
he never sat for; or his good name taken from him any
more than his money or possessions, at the arbitrary
will of another, &amp;c. I have but this to answer: the
money or possessions, I presume, are nothing to the
purpose; since no man can claim a right either to
those or a good name, if he has acted so as to forfeit
them. And are not the public the only judges what
share of reputation they think proper to allow any
man? Supposing I was capable, and had an inclination,
to draw all the good and bad characters in America,
why should a good man be offended with me for drawing
good characters? And if I draw ill ones, can they
fit any but those that deserve them? And ought any
but such to be concerned that they have their deserts?
I have as great an aversion and abhorrence for defamation
and scandal as any man, and would, with the utmost
care, avoid being guilty of such base things: besides
I am very sensible and certain, that if I should make
use of this paper to defame any person, my reputation
would be sooner hurt by it than his; and the Busy-Body
would quickly become detestable; because, in
such a case, as is justly observed, the pleasure arising
from a tale of wit and novelty soon dies away in generous
and honest minds, and is followed with a secret
grief, to see their neighbours calumniated. But if I myself
was actually the worst man in the province, and any
one should draw my true character, would it not be ridiculous
in me to say, he had defamed and scandalized me,
unless he had added in a matter of truth? If any thing
is meant by asking, why any man's picture should be
published which he never sat for? it must be, that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
should give no character without the owner's consent.
If I discern the wolf disguised in harmless wool, and
contriving the destruction of my neighbour's sheep,
must I have his permission, before I am allowed to discover
and prevent him? If I know a man to be a designing
knave, must I ask his consent, to bid my friends
beware of him? If so, then, by the same rule, supposing
the Busy-Body had really merited all his enemy had
charged him with, his consent likewise ought to have
been obtained, before so terrible an accusation was published
against him.</p>

<p>I shall conclude with observing, that in the last paragraph
save one of the piece now examined, much ill
nature and some good sense are co-inhabitants (as he
expresses it). The ill nature appears, in his endeavouring
to discover satire, where I intended no such thing,
but quite the reverse: the good sense is this, that drawing
too good a character of any one is a refined manner
of satire, that may be as injurious to him as the contrary,
by bringing on an examination that undresses the
person, and in the haste of doing it, he may happen to
be stript of what he really owns and deserves. As I
am Censor, I might punish the first, but I forgive it.
Yet I will not leave the latter unrewarded; but assure
my adversary, that in consideration of the merit of
those four lines, I am resolved to forbear injuring him
on any account in that refined manner.</p>

<p>I thank my neighbour P&mdash;&mdash; W&mdash;&mdash;l for his
kind letter.</p>

<p>One of the greatest pleasures an author can have,
is, certainly, the hearing his works applauded. The
hiding from the world our names, while we publish our
thoughts, is so absolutely necessary to this self-gratification,
that I hope my well-wishers will congratulate
me on my escape from the many diligent, but fruitless
enquiries, that have of late been made after me. Every
man will own, that an author, as such, ought to be hid
by the merit of his productions only; but pride, party,
and prejudice, at this time, run so very high, that experience
shows we form our notions of a piece by the
character of the author. Nay, there are some very
humble politicians in and about this city, who will ask,
on which side the writer is, before they presume to give
their opinion of the thing wrote. This ungenerous
way of proceeding I was well aware of before I published
my first speculation; and therefore concealed my
name. And I appeal to the more generous part of the
world, if I have, since I appeared in the character of the
Busy-Body, given an instance of my siding with any
party more than another, in the unhappy divisions of
my country; and I have, above all, this satisfaction in
myself, that neither affection, aversion, or interest, have
biassed me to use any partiality towards any man, or
set of men; but whatsoever I find nonsensical, ridiculous,
or immorally dishonest, I have, and shall continue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
openly to attack, with the freedom of an honest man,
and a lover of my country.</p>

<p>I profess I can hardly contain myself, or preserve the
gravity and dignity that should attend the censorial office,
when I hear the odd and unaccountable expositions,
that are put upon some of my works, through the
malicious ignorance of some, and the vain pride of more
than ordinary penetration in others; one instance of
which many of my readers are acquainted with. A
certain gentleman has taken a great deal of pains to
write a key to the letter in my Number IV, wherein
he has ingeniously converted a gentle satyr upon
tedious and impertinent visitants, into a libel on some
of the government. This I mention only as a specimen
of the taste of the gentleman; I am, forsooth,
bound to please in my speculations, not that I suppose
my impartiality will ever be called in question on that
account. Injustices of this nature I could complain of
in many instances; but I am at present diverted by the
reception of a letter, which, though it regards me only
in my private capacity, as an adept, yet I venture to
publish it for the entertainment of my readers.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="negidt1">"<em>To Censor Morum, Esq. Busy-Body General of the
Province of Pennsylvania, and the Counties of Newcastle,
Kent, and Sussex upon Delaware.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">"Honourable Sir,</p>

<p>"I judge by your lucubrations, that you are not
only a lover of truth and equity, but a man of parts and
learning, and a master of science; as such I honour
you. Know then, most profound sir, that I have, from
my youth up, been a very indefatigable student in, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
admirer of, that divine science, astrology. I have read
over Scot, Albertus Magnus, and Cornelius Agrippa,
above three hundred times; and was in hopes, by my
knowledge and industry, to gain enough to have recompensed
me for my money expended, and time lost in the
pursuit of this learning. You cannot be ignorant, sir,
(for your intimate second-sighted correspondent knows
all things) that there are large sums of money hidden
under ground in divers places about this town, and in
many parts of the country: but alas, sir, notwithstanding
I have used all the means laid down in the immortal
authors before mentioned, and when they failed the ingenious
Mr. P&mdash;d&mdash;l, with his mercurial wand and
magnet, I have still failed in my purpose. This, therefore,
I send, to propose and desire an acquaintance with
you, and I do not doubt, notwithstanding my repeated
ill fortune, but we may be exceedingly serviceable to
each other in our discoveries; and that if we use our
united endeavours, the time will come, when the Busy-Body,
his second-sighted correspondent, and your very
humble servant, will be three of the richest men in the
province: and then, sir, what may we not do? A word
to the wise is sufficient.</p>

<p class="right padr2">"TITAN <ins class="corr" title="Errata applied: 'for PLEIADS read PLEIADES'">PLEIADES</ins>."</p>

<p>In the evening after I had received this letter, I
made a visit to my second-sighted friend, and communicated
to him the proposal. When he had read it, he
assured me, that to his certain knowledge, there is not
at this time so much as one ounce of silver or gold hid
under ground in any part of this province; for that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
late and present scarcity of money had obliged those,
who were living, and knew where they had formerly hid
any, to take it up, and use it in their own necessary
affairs: and as to all the rest, which was buried by pirates
and others in old times, who were never like to
come for it, he himself had long since dug it all up,
and applied it to charitable uses; and this he desired me
to publish for the general good. For, as he acquainted
me, there are among us great numbers of honest artificers
and labouring people, who, fed with a vain hope of
growing suddenly rich, neglect their business, almost
to the ruining of themselves and families, and voluntarily
endure abundance of fatigue in a fruitless search
after imaginary hidden treasure. They wander through
the woods and bushes by day, to discover the marks
and signs; at midnight they repair to the hopeful spots
with spades and pickaxes; full of expectation, they labour
violently, trembling at the same time in every
joint, through fear of certain malicious demons, who
are said to haunt and guard such places. At length a
mighty hole is dug, and perhaps several cartloads of
earth thrown out; but, alas, no cag or iron pot is found!
no seaman's chest crammed with Spanish pistoles, or
weighty pieces of eight! Then they conclude, that
through some mistake in the procedure, some rash
word spoke, or some rule of art neglected, the guardian
spirit had power to sink it deeper into the earth, and
convey it out of their reach. Yet, when a man is once
thus infatuated, he is so far from being discouraged by
ill success, that he is rather animated to double his industry,
and will try again and again in a hundred different
places, in hopes at last of meeting with some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
lucky hit, that shall at once sufficiently reward him for
all his expense of time and labour.</p>

<p>This odd humour of digging for money through a
belief, that much has been hid by pirates formerly frequenting
the river, has for several years been mighty
prevalent among us; insomuch that you can hardly
walk half a mile out of the town on any side, without
observing several pits dug with that design, and perhaps
some lately opened. Men, otherwise of very
good sense, have been drawn into this practice, through
an overweening desire of sudden wealth, and an easy
credulity of what they so earnestly wished might be
true. While the rational and almost certain methods
of acquiring riches by industry and frugality are neglected
or forgotten. There seems to be some peculiar
charm in the conceit of finding money; and if the sands
of Schuylkil were so much mixed with small grains of
gold, that a man might in a day's time, with care and
application, get together to the value of half a crown,
I make no question but we should find several people
employed there, that can with ease earn five shillings a
day at their proper trades.</p>

<p>Many are the idle stories told of the private success
of some people, by which others are encouraged to proceed;
and the astrologers, with whom the country
swarms at this time, are either in the belief of these
things themselves, or find their advantage in persuading
others to believe them; for they are often consulted
about the critical times for digging, the methods of
laying the spirit, and the like whimsies, which renders
them very necessary to, and very much caressed by, the
poor deluded money-hunters.</p>

<p>There is certainly something very bewitching in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
pursuit after mines of gold and silver and other valuable
metals, and many have been ruined by it. A sea-captain
of my acquaintance used to blame the English for envying
Spain their mines of silver, and too much despising
or overlooking the advantages of their own industry
and manufactures. For my part, says he, I esteem
the banks of Newfoundland to be a more valuable possession
than the mountains of Potosi; and when I have
been there on the fishing account, have looked upon
every cod pulled up into the vessel as a certain quantity
of silver ore, which required only carrying to the
next Spanish port to be coined into pieces of eight;
not to mention the national profit of fitting out and
employing such a number of ships and seamen. Let
honest Peter Buckram, who has long, without success,
been a searcher after hidden money, reflect on this,
and be reclaimed from that unaccountable folly. Let
him consider, that every stitch he takes when he is on
his shop board is picking up part of a grain of gold,
that will in a few days time amount to a pistole; and
let Faber think the same of every nail he drives, or
every stroke with his plane. Such thoughts may make
them industrious, and of consequence in time they may
be wealthy. But how absurd is it to neglect a certain
profit for such a ridiculous whimsey: to spend whole
days at the George, in company with an idle pretender
to astrology, contriving schemes to discover what was
never hidden, and forgetful how carelessly business is
managed at home in their absence: to leave their wives
and a warm bed at midnight (no matter if it rain, hail,
snow, or blow a hurricane, provided that be the critical
hour) and fatigue themselves with the violent exercise
of digging for what they shall never find, and perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
getting a cold that may cost their lives, or at least disordering
themselves so as to be fit for no business
beside for some days after. Surely this is nothing less
than the most egregious folly and madness.</p>

<p>I shall conclude with the words of my discreet friend,
Agricola, of Chester County, when he gave his son a
good plantation:&mdash;"My son," says he, "I give thee
now a valuable parcel of land; I assure thee I have
found a considerable quantity of gold by digging there;
thee mayst do the same; but thee must carefully
observe this, Never to dig more than plow-deep."</p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Courteous Reader,</p>

<p>I have heard, that nothing gives an author so
great pleasure, as to find his works respectfully quoted
by others. Judge, then, how much I must have been
gratified by an incident I am going to relate to you.
I stopped my horse lately, where a great number of
people were collected, at an auction of merchants
goods. The hour of the sale not being come, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
were conversing on the badness of the times; and one
of the company called to a plain clean old man, with
white locks, 'Pray, Father Abraham, what think you
of the times? Will not these heavy taxes quite ruin the
country? How shall we ever be able to pay them?
What would you advise us to?'&mdash;Father Abraham stood
up, and replied, 'If you would have my advice, I will
give it you in short, "for a word to the wise is
enough," as Poor Richard says.' They joined in desiring
him to speak his mind, and gathering round him,
he proceeded as follows:</p>

<p>'Friends, says he, the taxes are, indeed, very heavy,
and, if those laid on by the government were the only
ones we had to pay, we might more easily discharge
them; but we have many others, and much more grievous
to some of us. We are taxed twice as much by
our idleness, three times as much by our pride, and four
times as much by our folly; and from these taxes the
commissioners cannot ease or deliver us, by allowing
an abatement. However, let us hearken to good advice,
and something may be done for us; "God helps
them that help themselves," as poor Richard says.</p>

<p>'I. It would be thought a hard government that
should tax its people one tenth part of their time, to
be employed in its service: but idleness taxes many of
us much more; sloth, by bringing on diseases, absolutely
shortens life. "Sloth, like rust, consumes faster
than labour wears, while the used key is always
bright," as poor Richard says. "But dost thou love
life, then do not squander time, for that is the stuff
life is made of," as poor Richard says. How much
more than is necessary do we spend in sleep! forgetting,
that "the sleeping fox catches no poultry, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
there will be sleeping enough in the grave," as poor
Richard says.</p>

<p>'"If time be of all things the most precious, wasting
time must be," as poor Richard says, "the greatest
prodigality;" since, as he elsewhere tells us, "lost time
is never found again; and what we call time enough
always proves little enough:" let us then up and be
doing, and doing to the purpose; so by diligence shall
we do more with less perplexity. "Sloth makes all
things difficult, but industry all easy; and he that
riseth late, must trot all day, and shall scarce overtake
his business at night; while laziness travels so slowly,
that poverty soon overtakes him. Drive thy business,
let not that drive thee; and early to bed, and early to
rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise," as poor
Richard says.</p>

<p>'So what signifies wishing and hoping for better
times? We may make these times better, if we bestir
ourselves. "Industry need not wish, and he that lives
upon hope will die fasting. There are no gains without
pains; then help hands, for I have no lands," or, if I
have, they are smartly taxed. "He, that hath a trade,
hath an estate; and he, that hath a calling, hath an
office of profit and honour," as poor Richard says; but
then the trade must be worked at, and the calling well
followed, or neither the estate nor the office will enable
us to pay our taxes. If we are industrious, we shall
never starve; for, "at the working man's house, hunger
looks in, but dares not enter." Nor will the bailiff
or the constable enter, for "industry pays debts, while
despair increaseth them." What though you have
found no treasure, nor has any rich relation left you a
legacy, "diligence is the mother of good luck, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
God gives all things to industry. Then plow deep,
while sluggards sleep, and you shall have corn to sell
and to keep." Work while it is called to-day, for you
know not how much you may be hindered to-morrow.
"One to-day is worth two to-morrows," as poor Richard
says; and farther, "never leave that till to-morrow,
which you can do to-day." If you were a servant,
would you not be ashamed that a good master should
catch you idle? Are you then your own master? Be
ashamed to catch yourself idle, when there is so much
to be done for yourself, your family, your country, and
your king. Handle your tools without mittens; remember,
that "the cat in gloves catches no mice," as
poor Richard says. It is true, there is much to be
done, and perhaps you are weak-handed; but stick to
it steadily, and you will see great effects, for "constant
dropping wears away stones; and by diligence and patience
the mouse ate in two the cable; and little strokes
fell great oaks."</p>

<p>'Methinks I hear some of you say, "must a man
afford himself no leisure?" I will tell thee, my friend,
what poor Richard says; "employ thy time well, if
thou meanest to gain leisure; and since thou art not
sure of a minute, throw not away an hour." Leisure is
time for doing something useful; this leisure the diligent
man will obtain, but the lazy man never; for "a
life of leisure and a life of laziness are two things.
Many, without labour, would live by their wits only,
but they break for want of stock;" whereas industry
gives comfort, and plenty, and respect. "Fly pleasures,
and they will follow you. The diligent spinner
has a large shift; and now I have a sheep and a cow,
every body bids me good-morrow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p>

<p>'II. But with our industry we must likewise be
steady, settled, and careful, and oversee our own affairs
with our own eyes, and not trust too much to others;
for, as poor Richard says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"I never saw an oft-removed tree,</p>
<p class="verse">Nor yet an oft-removed family,</p>
<p class="verse">That throve so well as those that settled be."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">And again, "three removes is as bad as a fire;" and
again, "keep thy shop, and thy shop will keep thee;"
and again, "if you would have your business done, go,
if not, send." And again,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"He that by the plough would thrive,</p>
<p class="verse">Himself must either hold or drive."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">And again, "the eye of a master will do more work
than both his hands;" and again, "want of care does
us more damage than want of knowledge;" and again,
"not to oversee workmen, is to leave them your purse
open." Trusting too much to other's care is the ruin of
many; for, "in the affairs of this world, men are
saved, not by faith, but by the want of it;" but a man's
own care is profitable; for, "if you would have a
faithful servant, and one that you like, serve yourself.
A little neglect may breed great mischief; for want of
a nail the shoe was lost, and for want of a shoe the
horse was lost, and for want of a horse the rider was
lost," being overtaken and slain by the enemy; all for
want of a little care about a horse-shoe nail.</p>

<p>'III. So much for industry, my friends, and attention
to ones own business; but to these we must add frugality,
if we would make our industry more certainly successful.
A man may, if he knows not how to save as
he gets, "keep his nose all his life to the grind-stone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
and die not worth a groat at last. A fat kitchen makes
a lean will;" and</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"Many estates are spent in the getting,</p>
<p class="verse">Since women for tea forsook spinning and knitting,</p>
<p class="verse">And men for punch forsook hewing and splitting."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">"If you would be wealthy, think of saving, as well as
of getting. The Indies have not made Spain rich, because
her outgoes are greater than her incomes."</p>

<p>'Away then, with your expensive follies, and you
will not then have so much cause to complain of hard
times, heavy taxes, and chargeable families; for</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"Women and wine, game and deceit,</p>
<p class="verse">Make the wealth small, and the want great."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">And farther, "what maintains one vice, would bring up
two children." You may think, perhaps, that a
little tea, or a little punch now and then, diet a little
more costly, clothes a little finer, and a little entertainment
now and then, can be no great matter; but remember,
"many a little makes a mickle." Beware of
little expences; "a small leak will sink a great ship,"
as poor Richard says; and again, "who dainties love,
shall beggars prove;" and moreover, "fools make
feasts, and wise men eat them."</p>

<p>'Here you are all got together to this sale of fineries
and nick-nacks. You call them <em>goods</em>, but if you do
not take care, they will prove <em>evils</em> to some of you.
You expect they will be sold cheap, and perhaps they
may, for less than they cost; but, if you have no occasion
for them, they must be dear to you. Remember
what poor Richard says, "buy what thou hast no need
of, and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries." And
again, "at a great penny-worth pause a while." He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
means, that perhaps the cheapness is apparent only,
and not real; or the bargain, by straitening thee in thy
business, may do thee more harm than good. For in
another place he says, "many have been ruined by
buying good pennyworths." Again, "it is foolish to
lay out money in a purchase of repentance;" and yet
this folly is practised every day at auctions, for want of
minding the almanack. Many a one, for the sake of
finery on the back, have gone with a hungry belly, and
half starved their families; "silks and satins, scarlet
and velvets, put out the kitchen fire," as poor Richard
says. These are not the necessaries of life, they can
scarcely be called the conveniences; and yet, only because
they look pretty, how many want to have them?
By these and other extravagancies, the genteel are
reduced to poverty, and forced to borrow of those
whom they formerly despised, but who, through industry
and frugality, have maintained their standing; in
which case it appears plainly, that "a ploughman on
his legs is higher than a gentleman on his knees," as
poor Richard says. Perhaps they have had a small
estate left them, which they knew not the getting of;
they think "it is day, and will never be night;" that a
little to be spent out of so much is not worth minding;
but "always taking out of the meal-tub, and never
putting in soon comes to the bottom," as poor Richard
says; and then, "when the well is dry, they know the
worth of water." But this they might have known
before, if they had taken his advice: "if you would
know the value of money go and try to borrow some;
for he that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing," as
poor Richard says; and indeed so does he that lends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
to such people, when he goes to get it in again. Poor
Dick farther advises, and says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"Fond pride of dress is sure a very curse,</p>
<p class="verse">Ere fancy you consult, consult your purse."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">And again, "pride is as loud a beggar as want, and a
great deal more saucy." When you have bought one
fine thing, you must buy ten more, that your appearance
may be all of a piece; but poor Dick says, "it is
easier to suppress the first desire than to satisfy all that
follow it:" and it is as truly folly for the poor to ape
the rich, as for the frog to swell, in order to equal
the ox.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"Vessels large may venture more,</p>
<p class="verse">But little boats should keep near shore."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">It is, however, a folly soon punished; for, as poor
Richard says, "pride that dines on vanity, sups on
contempt; pride breakfasted with plenty, dined with
poverty, and supped with infamy." And, after all, of
what use is this pride of appearance, for which so
much is risked, so much is suffered? It cannot promote
health, nor ease pain; it makes no increase of merit in
the person; it creates envy, it hastens misfortune.</p>

<p>'But what madness must it be to <em>run in debt</em> for
these superfluities! We are offered, by the terms of
this sale, six months credit; and that, perhaps, has induced
some of us to attend it, because we cannot
spare the ready money, and hope now to be fine without
it. But ah! think what you do when you run in
debt; you give to another power over your liberty. If
you cannot pay at the time, you will be ashamed to see
your creditor, you will be in fear when you speak to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
him, you will make poor pitiful sneaking excuses, and,
by degrees, come to lose your veracity, and sink into
base, downright lying; for, "the second vice is lying,
the <em>first</em> is running in debt," as poor Richard says; and
again, to the same purpose, "lying rides upon debt's
back;" whereas a free-born Englishman ought not to
be ashamed nor afraid to see or speak to any man living.
But poverty often deprives a man of all spirit
and virtue. "It is hard for an empty bag to stand
upright." What would you think of that prince, or of
that government, who should issue an edict, forbidding
you to dress like a gentleman or gentlewoman, on pain
of imprisonment or servitude? Would you not say, that
you were free, have a right to dress as you please, and
that such an edict would be a breach of your privileges,
and such a government tyrannical? And yet you are
about to put yourself under that tyranny, when you run
in debt for such dress! your creditor has authority, at
his pleasure, to deprive you of your liberty, by confining
you in gaol for life, or by selling you for a servant,
if you should not be able to pay him. When you have
got your bargain, you may, perhaps, think little of payment;
but, as poor Richard says, "creditors have
better memories than debtors; creditors are a superstitious
sect, great observers of set-days and times." The
day comes round before you are aware, and the demand
is made before you are prepared to satisfy it; or,
if you bear your debt in mind, the term, which at first
seemed so long, will, as it lessens, appear extremely
short: time will seem to have added wings to his heels
as well as his shoulders. "Those have a short lent,
who owe money to be paid at Easter." At present,
perhaps, you may think yourselves in thriving circumstances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
and that you can bear a little extravagance
without injury; but</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"For age and want save while you may,</p>
<p class="verse">No morning sun lasts a whole day."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Gain may be temporary and uncertain, but ever, while
you live, expence is constant and certain; and, "it is
easier to build two chimneys than to keep one in fuel,"
as poor Richard says: so "rather go to bed supperless
than rise in debt."</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"Get what you can, and what you get hold,</p>
<p class="verse">'Tis the stone that will turn all your lead into gold."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">And when you have got the philosopher's stone, sure
you will no longer complain of bad times, or the difficulty
of paying taxes.</p>

<p>'IV. This doctrine, my friends, is reason and wisdom:
but, after all, do not depend too much upon your
own industry, and frugality, and prudence, though
excellent things; for they may all be blasted, without
the blessing of heaven; and therefore ask that blessing
humbly, and be not uncharitable to those that at
present seem to want it, but comfort and help them.
Remember Job suffered, and was afterwards prosperous.</p>

<p>'And now, to conclude, "experience keeps a dear
school, but fools will learn in no other," as poor
Richard says, and scarce in that; for, it is true, "we
may give advice, but we cannot give conduct:" however,
remember this, "they that will not be counselled
cannot be helped;" and farther, that "if you will not
hear reason she will surely rap your knuckles," as poor
Richard says.'</p>

<p>Thus the old gentleman ended his harangue. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
people heard it and approved the doctrine; and immediately
practised the contrary, just as if it had been a
common sermon, for the auction opened and they
began to buy extravagantly.&mdash;I found the good man
had thoroughly studied my almanacks, and digested all
I had dropt on those topics during the course of twenty-five
years. The frequent mention he made of me
must have tired any one else; but my vanity was wonderfully
delighted with it, though I was conscious, that
not a tenth part of the wisdom was my own, which he
ascribed to me, but rather the gleanings that I had
made of the sense of all ages and nations. However, I
resolved to be the better for the echo of it; and,
though I had at first determined to buy stuff for a new
coat, I went away, resolved to wear my old one a little
longer. Reader, if thou wilt do the same, thy profit
will be as great as mine.</p>

<p class="pfs80">Written Anno 1748.</p>

<p class="pfs70 lsp2">TO MY FRIEND <span class="medium">A.B.</span></p>

<p class="pfs80">As you have desired it of me, I write the following hints, which have been
of service to me, and may, if observed, be so to you.</p>

<p>Remember, that <em>time</em> is money. He, that can
earn ten shillings a day by his labour, and goes abroad,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
or sits idle one half of that day, though he spends but
sixpence during his diversion or idleness, ought not to
reckon <em>that</em> the only expence; he has really spent, or
rather thrown away, five shillings besides.</p>

<p>Remember, that <em>credit</em> is money. If a man lets his
money lie in my hands after it is due, he gives me the
interest, or so much as I can make of it, during that
time. This amounts to a considerable sum where a
man has good and large credit, and makes good use
of it.</p>

<p>Remember, that money is of a prolific generating
nature. Money can beget money, and its offspring
can beget more, and so on. Five shillings turned is
six, turned again it is seven and three-pence, and so on
till it becomes an hundred pounds. The more there is
of it, the more it produces every turning, so that the
profits rise quicker and quicker. He that kills a breeding
sow destroys all her offspring to the thousandth
generation. He that murders a crown destroys all that
it might have produced, even scores of pounds.</p>

<p>Remember, that six pounds a year is but a groat a
day. For this little sum (which may be daily wasted
either in time or expence unperceived) a man of credit
may, on his own security, have the constant possession
and use of an hundred pounds. So much in
stock, briskly turned by an industrious man, produces
great advantage.</p>

<p>Remember this saying, "the good paymaster is lord
of another man's purse." He that is known to pay
punctually and exactly to the time he promises may
at any time, and on any occasion, raise all the money
his friends can spare. This is sometimes of great use.
After industry and frugality, nothing contributes more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
to the raising of a young man in the world than punctuality
and justice in all his dealings: therefore, never
keep borrowed money an hour beyond the time you
promised, lest a disappointment shut up your friend's
purse for ever.</p>

<p>The most trifling actions that affect a man's credit
are to be regarded. The sound of your hammer at five
in the morning, or nine at night, heard by a creditor,
makes him easy six months longer: but if he sees you
at a billiard-table, or hears your voice at a tavern,
when you should be at work, he sends for his money
the next day; demands it before he can receive it in a
lump.</p>

<p>It shows, besides, that you are mindful of what you
owe; it makes you appear a careful as well as an honest
man, and that still increases your credit.</p>

<p>Beware of thinking all your own that you possess,
and of living accordingly. It is a mistake that many
people who have credit fall into. To prevent this, keep
an exact account for some time, both of your expences
and your income. If you take the pains at first to
mention particulars, it will have this good effect: you
will discover how wonderfully small trifling expences
mount up to large sums, and will discern what might
have been, and may for the future be saved, without
occasioning any great inconvenience.</p>

<p>In short, the way to wealth, if you desire it, is as
plain as the way to market. It depends chiefly on two
words, <em>industry</em> and <em>frugality</em>; that is, waste neither
<em>time</em> nor <em>money</em>, but make the best use of both. Without
industry and frugality nothing will do, and with
them every thing. He, that gets all he can honestly,
and saves all he gets (necessary expences excepted),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
will certainly become <em>rich</em>&mdash;if that Being who governs
the world, to whom all should look for a blessing on
their honest endeavours, doth not, in his wise providence,
otherwise determine.</p>

<p>The use of money is all the advantage there is in
having money.</p>

<p>For six pounds a year you may have the use of one
hundred pounds, provided you are a man of known
prudence and honesty.</p>

<p>He, that spends a groat a day idly, spends idly above
six pounds a year, which is the price for the use of one
hundred pounds.</p>

<p>He, that wastes idly a groat's worth of his time per
day, one day with another, wastes the privilege of using
one hundred pounds each day.</p>

<p>He, that idly loses five shillings worth of time, loses
five shillings, and might as prudently throw five shillings
into the sea.</p>

<p>He, that loses five shillings, not only loses that sum,
but all the advantage that might be made by turning it
in dealing, which, by the time that a young man
becomes old, will amount to a considerable sum of
money.</p>

<p>Again: he, that sells upon credit, asks a price for
what he sells equivalent to the principal and interest of
his money for the time he is to be kept out of it;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
therefore, he, that buys upon credit, pays interest for
what he buys, and he, that pays ready money, might let
that money out to use: so that he, that possesses any
thing he has bought, pays interest for the use of it.</p>

<p>Yet, in buying goods, it is best to pay ready money,
because he, that sells upon credit, expects to lose five
per cent by bad debts; therefore he charges, on all he
sells upon credit, an advance, that shall make up that
deficiency.</p>

<p>Those, who pay for what they buy upon credit, pay
their share of this advance.</p>

<p>He, that pays ready money, escapes, or may escape,
that charge.</p>

<p>At this time, when the general complaint is, that
"money is scarce," it will be an act of kindness to
inform the moneyless how they may reinforce their
pockets. I will acquaint them with the true secret of
money-catching, the certain way to fill empty purses,
and how to keep them always full. Two simple rules,
well observed, will do the business.</p>

<p>First, let honesty and industry be thy constant companions;
and</p>

<p>Secondly, spend one penny less than thy clear
gains.</p>

<p>Then shall thy hide-bound pocket soon begin to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
thrive, and will never again cry with the empty belly-ach:
neither will creditors insult thee, nor want oppress,
nor hunger bite, nor nakedness freeze thee. The whole
hemisphere will shine brighter, and pleasure spring up
in every corner of thy heart. Now, therefore, embrace
these rules and be happy. Banish the bleak winds of
sorrow from thy mind, and live independent. Then
shalt thou be a man, and not hide thy face at the approach
of the rich, nor suffer the pain of feeling little
when the sons of fortune walk at thy right hand: for
independency, whether with little or much, is good
fortune, and placeth thee on even ground with the
proudest of the golden fleece. Oh, then, be wise, and
let industry walk with thee in the morning, and attend
thee until thou reachest the evening hour for rest. Let
honesty be as the breath of thy soul, and never forget
to have a penny when all thy expences are enumerated
and paid: then shalt thou reach the point of happiness,
and independence shall be thy shield and buckler, thy
helmet and crown; then shall thy soul walk upright, nor
stoop to the silken wretch because he hath riches, nor
pocket an abuse because the hand which offers it wears
a ring set with diamonds.</p>

<p class="pfs70 lsp2">TO THE AUTHORS OF THE JOURNAL.</p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Messieurs,</p>

<p>You often entertain us with accounts of new discoveries.
Permit me to communicate to the public,
through your paper, one, that has lately been made by
myself, and which I conceive may be of great utility.</p>

<p>I was the other evening in a grand company, where
the new lamp of Messrs. Quinquet and Lange was
introduced, and much admired for its splendor; but a
general enquiry was made, whether the oil it consumed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
was not in proportion to the light it afforded, in which
case there would be no saving in the use of it. No one
present could satisfy us in that point, which all agreed
ought to be known, it being a very desirable thing to
lessen, if possible, the expence of lighting our apartments,
when every other article of family expence was
so much augmented.</p>

<p>I was pleased to see this general concern for economy,
for I love economy exceedingly.</p>

<p>I went home, and to bed, three or four hours after
midnight, with my head full of the subject. An accidental
sudden noise waked me about six in the morning,
when I was surprised to find my room filled with
light; and I imagined at first, that a number of those
lamps had been brought into it: but, rubbing my eyes,
I perceived the light came in at the windows. I got
up and looked out to see what might be the occasion of
it, when I saw the sun just rising above the horison,
from whence he poured his rays plentifully into my
chamber, my domestic having negligently omitted the
preceding evening to close the shutters.</p>

<p>I looked at my watch, which goes very well, and
found that it was but six o'clock; and still thinking it
something extraordinary, that the sun should rise so
early, I looked into the almanack, where I found it to
be the hour given for his rising on that day. I looked
forward too, and found he was to rise still earlier every
day till towards the end of June; and that at no time
in the year he retarded his rising so long as till eight
o'clock. Your readers, who with me have never seen
any signs of sunshine before noon, and seldom regard
the astronomical part of the almanack, will be as much
astonished as I was, when they hear of his rising so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
early; and especially when I assure them, <em>that he gives
light as soon as he rises</em>. I am convinced of this. I am
certain of my fact. One cannot be more certain of
any fact. I saw it with my own eyes. And, having
repeated this observation the three following mornings,
I found always precisely the same result.</p>

<p>Yet so it happens, that when I speak of this discovery
to others, I can easily perceive by their countenances,
though they forbear expressing it in words, that
they do not quite believe me. One, indeed, who is a
learned natural philosopher, has assured me, that I
must certainly be mistaken as to the circumstance of
the light coming into my room; for it being well
known, as he says, that there could be no light abroad
at that hour, it follows that none could enter from
without; and that of consequence, my windows being
accidentally left open, instead of letting in the light,
had only served to let out the darkness: and he used
many ingenious arguments to shew me how I might,
by that means, have been deceived. I own, that he
puzzled me a little, but he did not satisfy me; and the
subsequent observations I made, as above mentioned,
confirmed me in my first opinion.</p>

<p>This event has given rise in my mind to several serious
and important reflections. I considered that, if I
had not been awakened so early in the morning, I
should have slept six hours longer by the light of the
sun, and in exchange have lived six hours the following
night by candle-light; and the latter being a much
more expensive light than the former, my love of economy
induced me to muster up what little arithmetic I
was master of, and to make some calculations, which I
shall give you, after observing that utility is, in my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
opinion, the test of value in matters of invention, and
that a discovery which can be applied to no use, or is
not good for something, is good for nothing.</p>

<p>I took for the basis of my calculation the supposition
that there are 100,000 families in Paris, and that these
families consume in the night half a pound of bougies,
or candles per hour. I think this is a moderate allowance,
taking one family with another; for though I
believe some consume less, I know that many consume
a great deal more. Then estimating seven hours per
day, as the medium quantity between the time of the
sun's rising and ours, he rising during the six following
months from six to eight hours before noon, and there
being seven hours of course per night in which we burn
candles, the account will stand thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the six months between the twentieth of March
and the twentieth of September, there are</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="90%" summary="Candles">

  one hundred thousand hours, spent at

  a pound of wax and tallow per hour,
  gives the weight of</td><td class="tdr tdb">64,050,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Sixty-four millions and fifty thousand of
  pounds, which, estimating the whole
  at the medium price of thirty sols the
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
  pound, makes the sum of ninety-six
  millions and seventy-five thousand
  livres tournois</td><td class="tdr tdb">96,075,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>An immense sum! that the city of Paris might save
every year, by the economy of using sunshine instead
of candles.</p>

<p>If it should be said, that people are apt to be obstinately
attached to old customs, and that it will be difficult
to induce them to rise before noon, consequently
my discovery can be of little use: I answer, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nil desperandum</i>.
I believe all who have common sense, as
soon as they have learnt from this paper that it is day-light
when the sun rises, will contrive to rise with him;
and, to compel the rest, I would propose the following
regulations:</p>

<p>First. Let a tax be laid of a louis per window, on
every window that is provided with shutters to keep out
the light of the sun.</p>

<p>Second. Let the same salutary operation of police be
made use of to prevent our burning candles, that inclined
us last winter to be more economical in burning
wood; that is, let guards be placed in the shops of the
wax and tallow chandlers, and no family be permitted
to be supplied with more than one pound of candles
per week.</p>

<p>Third. Let guards also be posted to stop all the
coaches, &amp;c. that would pass the streets after sun-set,
except those of physicians, surgeons, and midwives.</p>

<p>Fourth. Every morning, as soon as the run rises, let
all the bells in every church be set ringing; and if that
is not sufficient, let cannon be fired in every street, to
wake the sluggards effectually, and make them open
their eyes to see their true interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>

<p>All the difficulty will be in the first two or three
days: after which the reformation will be as natural
and easy as the present irregularity: for, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ce n'est que le
premier pas qui coute</i>. Oblige a man to rise at four in
the morning, and it is more than probable he shall go
willingly to bed at eight in the evening; and, having had
eight hours sleep, he will rise more willingly at four the
morning following. But this sum of ninety-six millions
and seventy-five thousand livres is not the whole of
what may be saved by my economical project. You
may observe, that I have calculated upon only one half
of the year, and much may be saved in the other,
though the days are shorter. Besides, the immense
stock of wax and tallow left unconsumed during the
summer will probably make candles much cheaper for
the ensuing winter, and continue them cheaper as long
as the proposed reformation shall be supported.</p>

<p>For the great benefit of this discovery, thus freely
communicated and bestowed by me on the public, I
demand neither place, pension, exclusive privilege, nor
any other reward whatever. I expect only to have the
honour of it. And yet I know there are little envious
minds who will, as usual, deny me this, and say, that
my invention was known to the ancients, and perhaps
they may bring passages out of the old books in proof
of it. I will not dispute with these people, that the ancients
knew not the sun would rise at certain hours;
they possibly had, as we have, almanacks that predicted
it: but it does not follow from thence, that they
knew <em>he gave light as soon as he rose</em>. This is what I
claim as my discovery. If the antients knew it, it
might have been long since forgotten, for it certainly
was unknown to the moderns, at least to the Parisians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
which to prove, I need use but one plain simple argument.
They are as well-instructed, judicious and prudent
a people as exist any where in the world, all professing,
like myself, to be lovers of economy; and, from
the many heavy taxes required from them by the necessities
of the state, have surely an abundant reason to
be economical. I say it is impossible, that so sensible
a people, under such circumstances, should have lived
so long by the smoaky, unwholesome and enormously
expensive light of candles, if they had really known,
that they might have had as much pure light of the sun
for nothing.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>On early Marriages.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Craven Street, Aug. 9, 1768</em>.</p>

<p class="xs pad2">DEAR JACK,</p>

<p>You desire, you say, my impartial thoughts on the
subject of an early marriage, by way of answer to the
numberless objections, that have been made by numberless
persons, to your own. You may remember, when
you consulted me on the occasion, that I thought youth
on both sides to be no objection. Indeed, from the
marriages that have fallen under my observation, I am
rather inclined to think, that early ones stand the best
chance of happiness. The temper and habits of the
young are not yet become so stiff and uncomplying, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
when more advanced in life; they form more easily to
each other, and hence many occasions of disgust are
removed. And if youth has less of that prudence, which
is necessary to manage a family, yet the parents and
elder friends of young married persons are generally at
hand to afford their advice, which amply supplies that
defect; and by early marriage, youth is sooner formed
to regular and useful life; and possibly some of those
accidents or connections, that might have injured the
constitution, or reputation, or both, are thereby happily
prevented. Particular circumstances of particular
persons may possibly sometimes make it prudent to
delay entering into that state; but in general, when nature
has rendered our bodies fit for it, the presumption
is in nature's favour, that she has not judged amiss in
making us desire it. Late marriages are often attended,
too, with this further inconvenience, that there is not
the same chance that the parents shall live to see their
offspring educated. "Late children," says the Spanish
proverb, "are early orphans." A melancholy reflection
to those whose case it may be! With us in America,
marriages are generally in the morning of life; our
children are therefore educated and settled in the world
by noon; and thus, our business being done, we have
an afternoon and evening of cheerful leisure to ourselves,
such as our friend at present enjoys. By these
early marriages we are blessed with more children; and
from the mode among us, founded by nature, of every
mother suckling and nursing her own child, more of
them are raised. Thence the swift progress of population
among us, unparalleled in Europe. In fine, I am
glad you are married, and congratulate you most cordially
upon it. You are now in the way of becoming a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
useful citizen; and you have escaped the unnatural state
of celibacy for life&mdash;the fate of many here, who never
intended it, but who, having too long postponed the
change of their condition, find, at length, that it is too
late to think of it, and so live all their lives in a situation,
that greatly lessens a man's value. An odd volume of
a set of books bears not the value of its proportion to
the set: what think you of the odd half of a pair of
scissars? it cannot well cut any thing; it may possibly
serve to scrape a trencher.</p>

<p>Pray make my compliments and best wishes acceptable
to your bride. I am old and heavy, or I should ere
this have presented them in person. I shall make but
small use of the old man's privilege, that of giving advice
to younger friends. Treat your wife always with respect;
it will procure respect to you, not only from her, but
from all that observe it. Never use a slighting expression
to her, even in jest; for slights in jest, after frequent
bandyings, are apt to end in angry earnest. Be
studious in your profession, and you will be learned.
Be industrious and frugal, and you will be rich. Be
sober and temperate, and you will be healthy. Be in
general virtuous, and you will be happy. At least, you
will, by such conduct, stand the best chance for such
consequences. I pray God to bless you both! being
ever your affectionate friend,</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Effect of early Impressions on the Mind.</em></a></h3>

<p class="smcap pad2">Rev. Sir,</p>

<p>I received your kind letter, with your excellent
advice to the people of the United States, which I read
with great pleasure, and hope it will be duly regarded.
Such writings, though they may be lightly passed over
by many readers, yet, if they make a deep impression
on one active mind in a hundred, the effects may be
considerable.</p>

<p>Permit me to mention one little instance, which,
though it relates to myself, will not be quite uninteresting
to you. When I was a boy, I met with a book entitled,
"Essays to do good," which I think was written
by your father. It had been so little regarded by a
former possessor, that several leaves of it were torn out;
but the remainder gave me such a turn of thinking, as
to have an influence on my conduct through life: for I
have always set a greater value on the character of a
doer of good, than any other kind of reputation; and
if I have been, as you seem to think, a useful citizen,
the public owes the advantage of it to that book.</p>

<p>You mention your being in your seventy-eighth year.
I am in my seventy ninth. We are grown old together.
It is now more than sixty years since I left Boston;
but I remember well both your father and grandfather,
having heard them both in the pulpit, and seen
them in their houses. The last time I saw your father
was in the beginning of 1724, when I visited him after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
my first trip to Pensylvania. He received me in his
library; and, on my taking leave, showed me a shorter
way out of the house, through a narrow passage, which
was crossed by a beam overhead. We were still talking
as I withdrew, he accompanying me behind, and I
turning partly towards him, when he said hastily,
"Stoop, stoop!" I did not understand him, till I felt
my head hit against the beam. He was a man who
never missed any occasion of giving instruction; and
upon this he said to me: "You are young, and have
the world before you: stoop as you go through it, and
you will miss many hard thumps." This advice, thus
beat into my heart, has frequently been of use to me:
and I often think of it, when I see pride mortified, and
misfortunes brought upon people by their carrying their
heads too high.</p>

<p>I long much to see again my native place; and once
hoped to lay my bones there. I left it in 1723. I visited
it in 1733, 1743, 1753, and 1763; and in 1773 I
was in England. In 1775 I had a sight of it, but could
not enter, it being in possession of the enemy. I did
hope to have been there in 1783, but could not obtain
my dismission from this employment here; and now I
fear I shall never have that happiness. My best wishes
however attend my dear country, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">esto perpetua</i>." It
is now blessed with an excellent constitution: may it
last for ever!</p>

<p>This powerful monarchy continues its friendship for
the United States. It is a friendship of the utmost importance
to our security, and should be carefully cultivated.
Britain has not yet well digested the loss of its
dominion over us; and has still at times some flattering
hopes of recovering it. Accidents may increase those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
hopes, and encourage dangerous attempts. A breach
between us and France would infallibly bring the English
again upon our backs: and yet we have some wild
beasts among our countrymen, who are endeavouring
to weaken that connection.</p>

<p>Let us preserve our reputation, by performing our
engagements; our credit, by fulfilling our contracts;
and our friends, by gratitude and kindness: for we
know not how soon we may again have occasion for all
of them.</p>

<p>I received my dear friend's two letters, one for
Wednesday, and one for Saturday. This is again
Wednesday. I do not deserve one for to day, because
I have not answered the former. But indolent as I am,
and averse to writing, the fear of having no more of

your pleasing epistles, if I do not contribute to the correspondence,
obliges me to take up my pen: and as

evening, as I have done its name-sakes, in your delightful

<p>I am charmed with your description of Paradise, and
with your plan of living there; and I approve much of
your conclusion, that in the mean time, we should draw
all the good we can from this world. In my opinion,
we might all draw more good from it than we do, and

directly to a shop where they sold toys for children;
and being charmed with the sound of a <em>whistle</em>, that I
met by the way in the hands of another boy, I voluntarily
offered him all my money for it. I then came
home, and went whistling all over the house, much
pleased with my <em>whistle</em>, but disturbing all the family.
My brothers, and sisters, and cousins, understanding
the bargain I had made, told me I had given four times
as much for it as it was worth. This put me in mind
what good things I might have bought with the rest of
the money; and they laughed at me so much for my
folly, that I cried with vexation; and the reflection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
gave me more chagrin, than the <em>whistle</em> gave me
pleasure.</p>

<p>This however was afterwards of use to me, the impression
continuing on my mind; so that often, when
I was tempted to buy some unnecessary thing, I said to
myself, <em>Don't give too much for the whistle</em>; and so I
saved my money.</p>

<p>As I grew up, came into the world, and observed the
actions of men, I thought I met with many, very many,
who <em>gave too much for the whistle</em>.</p>

<p>When I saw any one too ambitious of court favours,
sacrificing his time in attendance on levees, his repose,
his liberty, his virtue, and perhaps his friends, to attain
it, I have said to myself, <em>This man gives too much for his
whistle</em>.</p>

<p>When I saw another fond of popularity, constantly
employing himself in political bustles, neglecting his
own affairs, and ruining them by that neglect, <em>He pays,
indeed</em>, says I, <em>too much for his whistle</em>.</p>

<p>If I knew a miser, who gave up every kind of comfortable
living, all the pleasure of doing good to others,
all the esteem of his fellow-citizens, and the joys of benevolent
friendship, for the sake of accumulating
wealth, <em>Poor man</em>, says I, <em>you pay too much for your
whistle</em>.</p>

<p>When I meet a man of pleasure, sacrificing every
laudable improvement of the mind, or of his fortune, to
mere corporeal sensations, and ruining his health in
their pursuit, <em>Mistaken man</em>, says I, <em>you are providing
pain for yourself, instead of pleasure: you give too much
for your whistle</em>.</p>

<p>If I see one fond of appearance, of fine clothes, fine
houses, fine furniture, fine equipages, all above his fortune,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
for which he contracts debts, and ends his career
in a prison, <em>Alas</em>, says I, <em>he has paid dear, very dear,
for his whistle</em>.</p>

<p>When I see a beautiful, sweet-tempered girl, married
to an ill-natured brute of a husband, <em>What a pity it is</em>,
says I, <em>that she has paid so much for a whistle</em>!</p>

<p>In short, I conceived, that great part of the miseries
of mankind were brought upon them by the false estimates
they had made of the value of things, and by
their giving too much for their <em>whistles</em>.</p>

<p>Yet I ought to have charity for these unhappy people,
when I consider, that with all this wisdom of which
I am boasting, there are certain things in the world so
tempting, for example, the apples of king John, which
happily are not to be bought; for if they were put to
sale by auction, I might very easily be led to ruin myself
in the purchase, and find, that I had once more
given too much for the <em>whistle</em>.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dearest friend, and believe me ever yours
very sincerely and with unalterable affection,</p>

<p>I address myself to all the friends of youth, and
conjure them to direct their compassionate regards to
my unhappy fate, in order to remove the prejudices of
which I am the victim. There are twin sisters of us:
and the two eyes of man do not more resemble, nor are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
capable of being upon better terms with each other,
than my sister and myself, were it not for the partiality
of our parents, who make the most injurious distinctions
between us. From my infancy, I have been led to
consider my sister as a being of a more elevated rank.
I was suffered to grow up without the least instruction,
while nothing was spared in her education. She had
masters to teach her writing, drawing, music, and other
accomplishments; but if by chance I touched a pencil,
a pen, or a needle, I was bitterly rebuked: and more
than once I have been beaten for being aukward, and
wanting a graceful manner. It is true, my sister associated
me with her upon some occasions; but she
always made a point of taking the lead, calling upon
me only from necessity, or to figure by her side.</p>

<p>But conceive not, sirs, that my complaints are instigated
merely by vanity&mdash;No; my uneasiness is occasioned
by an object much more serious. It is the practice
in our family, that the whole business of providing
for its subsistence falls upon my sister and myself. If
any indisposition should attack my sister&mdash;and I mention
it in confidence upon this occasion, that she is
subject to the gout, the rheumatism and cramp, without
making mention of other accidents&mdash;what would
be the fate of our poor family? Must not the regret of
our parents be excessive, at having placed so great a
difference between sisters, who are so perfectly equal?
Alas! we must perish from distress: for it would not
be in my power even to scrawl a suppliant petition for
relief, having been obliged to employ the hand of another
in transcribing the request, which I have now the
honour to prefer to you.</p>

<p>Condescend, sirs, to make my parents sensible of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
injustice of an exclusive tenderness, and of the necessity
of distributing their care and affection among all
their children equally.</p>

<p>There are two sorts of people in the world, who,
with equal degrees of health and wealth, and the other
comforts of life, become, the one happy, and the other
miserable. This arises very much from the different
views in which they consider things, persons, and
events; and the effect of those different views upon
their own minds.</p>

<p>In whatever situation men can be placed, they may
find conveniences and inconveniences; in whatever
company, they may find persons and conversation more
or less pleasing: at whatever table, they may meet with
meats and drinks of better and worse taste, dishes better
and worse dressed; in whatever climate, they will
find good and bad weather: under whatever government,
they may find good and bad laws, and good and
bad administration of those laws; in whatever poem, or
work of genius, they may see faults and beauties; in
almost every face, and every person, they may discover
fine features and defects, good and bad qualities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span></p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the two sorts of people
above mentioned fix their attention, those, who are disposed
to be happy, on the conveniences of things, the
pleasant parts of conversation, the well-dressed dishes,
the goodness of the wines, the fine weather, &amp;c. and
enjoy all with cheerfulness. Those, who are to be unhappy,
think and speak only of the contraries. Hence
they are continually discontented themselves, and, by
their remarks, sour the pleasures of society, offend
personally many people, and make themselves every
where disagreeable. If this turn of mind was founded
in nature, such unhappy persons would be the more to
be pitied. But as the disposition to criticise, and to be
disgusted, is, perhaps, taken up originally by imitation,
and is, unawares, grown into a habit, which, though at
present strong, may nevertheless be cured, when those
who have it are convinced of its bad effects on their felicity;
I hope this little admonition may be of service
to them, and put them on changing a habit, which,
though in the exercise it is chiefly an act of imagination,
yet has serious consequences in life, as it brings
on real griefs and misfortunes. For, as many are offended
by, and nobody loves, this sort of people, no
one shows them more than the most common civility
and respect, and scarcely that; and this frequently puts
them out of humour, and draws them into disputes and
contentions. If they aim at obtaining some advantage
in rank or fortune, nobody wishes them success, or will
stir a step, or speak a word, to favour their pretensions.
If they incur public censure or disgrace, no one will
defend or excuse, and many join to aggravate their
misconduct, and render them completely odious. If
these people will not change this bad habit, and condescend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
to be pleased with what is pleasing, without fretting
themselves and others about the contraries, it is
good for others to avoid an acquaintance with them;
which is always disagreeable, and sometimes very inconvenient,
especially when one finds oneself entangled
in their quarrels.</p>

<p>An old philosophical friend of mine was grown, from
experience, very cautious in this particular, and carefully
avoided any intimacy with such people. He had,
like other philosophers, a thermometer, to show him the
heat of the weather, and a barometer, to mark when
it was likely to prove good or bad; but there being no
instrument invented to discover, at first sight, this unpleasing
disposition in a person, he, for that purpose,
made use of his legs; one of which was remarkably
handsome, the other, by some accident, crooked and
deformed. If a stranger, at the first interview, regarded
his ugly leg more than his handsome one, he doubted
him. If he spoke of it, and took no notice of the
handsome leg, that was sufficient to determine my philosopher
to have no further acquaintance with him.
Every body has not this two-legged instrument; but
every one, with a little attention, may observe signs of
that carping, fault-finding disposition, and take the
same resolution of avoiding the acquaintance of those
infected with it, I therefore advise those critical querulous,
discontented, unhappy people, that, if they wish
to be respected and beloved by others, and happy in
themselves, they should <em>leave off looking at the ugly leg</em>.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Morals of Chess.</em></a><a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></h3>

<p>Playing at chess is the most ancient and most
universal game known among men; for its original is
beyond the memory of history, and it has, for numberless
ages, been the amusement of all the civilized nations
of Asia, the Persians, the Indians, and the Chinese.
Europe has had it above a thousand years; the
Spaniards have spread it over their part of America,
and it begins lately to make its appearance in these
states. It is so interesting in itself, as not to need the
view of gain to induce engaging in it; and thence it is
never played for money. Those, therefore, who have
leisure for such diversions, cannot find one that is more
innocent; and the following piece, written with a view
to correct (among a few young friends) some little improprieties
in the practice of it, shows, at the same
time, that it may, in its effects on the mind, be not
merely innocent, but advantageous, to the vanquished
as well as the victor.</p>

<p>The game of chess is not merely an idle amusement.
Several very valuable qualities of the mind, useful in
the course of human life, are to be acquired or strengthened
by it, so as to become habits, ready on all occasions.
For life is a kind of chess, in which we have
often points to gain, and competitors or adversaries to
contend with, and in which there is a vast variety of
good and ill events, that are, in some degree, the effects
of prudence or the want of it. By playing at chess,
then, we may learn,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span></p>
<p>I. <em>Foresight</em>, which looks a little into futurity, and
considers the consequences that may attend an action:
for it is continually occurring to the player, "If I move
this piece, what will be the advantage of my new situation?
What use can my adversary make of it to annoy
me? What other moves can I make to support it, and
to defend myself from his attacks?"</p>

<p>II. <em>Circumspection</em>, which surveys the whole chess-board,
or scene of action, the relations of the several
pieces and situations, the dangers they are respectively
exposed to, the several possibilities of their aiding each
other, the probabilities that the adversary may take
this or that move, and attack this or the other piece,
and what different means can be used to avoid his
stroke, or turn its consequences against him.</p>

<p>III. <em>Caution</em>, not to make our moves too hastily.
This habit is best acquired by observing strictly the
laws of the game, such as, "If you touch a piece, you
must move it somewhere: if you set it down, you must
let it stand:" and it is therefore best that these rules
should be observed, as the game thereby becomes more
the image of human life, and particularly of war; in
which, if you have incautiously put yourself into a bad
and dangerous position, you cannot obtain your enemy's
leave to withdraw your troops, and place them
more securely, but you must abide all the consequences
of your rashness.</p>

<p>And, lastly, we learn by chess the habit of <em>not being
discouraged by present bad appearances in the state of our
affairs</em>, the habit of <em>hoping for a favourable change</em>, and
that of <em>persevering in the search of resources</em>. The game
is so full of events, there is such a variety of turns in
it, the fortune of it is so subject to sudden vicissitudes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
and one so frequently, after long contemplation, discovers
the means of extricating oneself from a supposed
insurmountable difficulty, that one is encouraged to
continue the contest to the last, in hopes of victory by
our own skill, or at least of getting a stale mate, by the
negligence of our adversary. And whoever considers,
what in chess he often sees instances of, that particular
pieces of success are apt to produce presumption, and
its consequent inattention, by which the loss may be
recovered, will learn not to be too much discouraged
by the present success of his adversary, nor to despair
of final good fortune upon every little check he receives
in the pursuit of it.</p>

<p>That we may, therefore, be induced more frequently
to choose this beneficial amusement, in preference to
others, which are not attended with the same advantages,
every circumstance which may increase the pleasures
of it should be regarded; and every action or
word that is unfair, disrespectful, or that in any way
may give uneasiness, should be avoided, as contrary to
the immediate intention of both the players, which is
to pass the time agreeably.</p>

<p>Therefore, first, if it is agreed, to play according to
the strict rules; then those rules are to be exactly observed
by both parties, and should not be insisted on
for one side, while deviated from by the other&mdash;for this
is not equitable.</p>

<p>Secondly, if it is agreed, not to observe the rules
exactly, but one party demands indulgencies, he should
then be as willing to allow them to the other.</p>

<p>Thirdly, no false move should ever be made to extricate
yourself out of difficulty, or to gain an advantage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
There can be no pleasure in playing with a
person once detected in such unfair practice.</p>

<p>Fourthly, if your adversary is long in playing you
ought not to hurry him, or express any uneasiness at
his delay. You should not sing, nor whistle, nor look
at your watch, nor take up a book to read, nor make a
tapping with your feet on the floor, or with your fingers
on the table, nor do any thing that may disturb his
attention. For all these things displease; and they do
not show your skill in playing, but your craftiness or
your rudeness.</p>

<p>Fifthly, you ought not to endeavour to amuse and
deceive your adversary, by pretending to have made
bad moves, and saying, that you have now lost the
game, in order to make him secure and careless, and
inattentive to your schemes: for this is fraud and deceit,
not skill in the game.</p>

<p>Sixthly, you must not, when you have gained a victory,
use any triumphing or insulting expression, nor
show too much pleasure; but endeavour to console
your adversary, and make him less dissatisfied with
himself, by every kind of civil expression, that may be
used with truth, such as, "you understand the game
better than I, but you are a little inattentive;" or,
"you play too fast;" or, "you had the best of the
game, but something happened to divert your thoughts,
and that turned it in my favour."</p>

<p>Seventhly, if you are a spectator while others play,
observe the most perfect silence. For if you give advice,
you offend both parties, him against whom you
give it, because it may cause the loss of his game, him
in whose favour you give it, because, though it be good
and he follows it, he loses the pleasure he might have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
had, if you had permitted him to think until it had
occurred to himself. Even after a move or moves,
you must not, by replacing the pieces, show how it
might have been placed better: for that displeases, and
may occasion disputes and doubts about their true
situation. All talking to the players lessens or diverts
their attention, and is therefore unpleasing. Nor
should you give the least hint to either party, by any
kind of noise or motion. If you do, you are unworthy
to be a spectator. If you have a mind to exercise or
show your judgment, do it in playing your own game,
when you have an opportunity, not in criticising, or
meddling with, or counselling the play of others.</p>

<p>Lastly, if the game is not to be played rigorously,
according to the rules above mentioned, then moderate
your desire of victory over your adversary, and be
pleased with one over yourself. Snatch not eagerly at
every advantage offered by his unskilfulness or inattention;
but point out to him kindly, that by such a move
he places or leaves a piece in danger and unsupported;
that by another he will put his king in a perilous situation,
&amp;c. By this generous civility (so opposite to the unfairness
above forbidden) you may, indeed, happen
to lose the game to your opponent, but you will win
what is better, his esteem, his respect, and his affection,
together with the silent approbation and good-will
of impartial spectators.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>The Art of procuring Pleasant Dreams.</em></a><a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></h3>

<p class="center xs lsp2 mm1">INSCRIBED TO MISS ****,</p>

<p class="pfs80">Being written at her request.</p>

<p>As a great part of our life is spent in sleep, during
which we have sometimes pleasing, and sometimes painful
dreams, it becomes of some consequence to obtain
the one kind, and avoid the other; for, whether real or
imaginary, pain is pain, and pleasure is pleasure. If
we can sleep without dreaming, it is well that painful
dreams are avoided. If, while we sleep, we can have
any pleasing dreams, it is, as the French say, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tant
gagné</i>, so much added to the pleasure of life.</p>

<p>To this end, it is, in the first place, necessary, to be
careful in preserving health, by due exercise, and great
temperance; for, in sickness, the imagination is disturbed;
and disagreeable, sometimes terrible, ideas are apt
to present themselves. Exercise should precede meals,
not immediately follow them: the first promotes, the
latter, unless moderate, obstructs digestion. If, after
exercise, we feed sparingly, the digestion will be easy
and good, the body lightsome, the temper cheerful,
and all the animal functions performed agreeably.
Sleep, when it follows, will be natural and undisturbed,
while indolence, with full feeding, occasions nightmares
and horrors inexpressible: we fall from precipices,
are assaulted by wild beasts, murderers, and
demons, and experience every variety of distress. Observe,
however, that the quantities of food and exercise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
are relative things: those who move much may, and
indeed ought, to eat more; those who use little exercise
should eat little. In general, mankind, since the
improvement of cookery, eat about twice as much as
nature requires. Suppers are not bad, if we have not
dined; but restless nights naturally follow hearty suppers,
after full dinners. Indeed, as there is a difference
in constitutions, some rest well after these meals; it
costs them only a frightful dream, and an apoplexy,
after which they sleep till doomsday. Nothing is more
common in the newspapers, than instances of people,
who, after eating a hearty supper, are found dead a-bed
in the morning.</p>

<p>Another means of preserving health, to be attended
to, is the having a constant supply of fresh air in your
bed-chamber. It has been a great mistake, the sleeping
in rooms exactly closed, and in beds surrounded by
curtains. No outward air that may come into you is
so unwholesome, as the unchanged air, often breathed,
of a close chamber. As boiling water does not grow
hotter by longer boiling, if the particles that receive
greater heat can escape; so living bodies do not putrify,
if the particles, as fast as they become putrid, can
be thrown off. Nature expels them by the pores of
the skin and the lungs, and in a free open air they are
carried off; but, in a close room, we receive them
again and again, though they become more and more
corrupt. A number of persons crowded into a small
room thus spoil the air in a few minutes, and even render
it mortal, as in the Black Hole at Calcutta. A single
person is said to spoil only a gallon of air per
minute, and therefore requires a longer time to spoil a
chamber full; but it is done, however, in proportion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
and many putrid disorders hence have their origin. It
is recorded of Methusalem, who, being the longest
liver, may be supposed to have best preserved his
health, that he slept always in the open air; for, when
he had lived five hundred years, an angel said to him:
"Arise, Methusalem, and build thee an house, for thou
shalt live yet five hundred years longer." But Methusalem
answered and said, "If I am to live but five hundred
years longer it is not worth while to build me an
house&mdash;I will sleep in the air, as I have been used to
do." Physicians, after having for ages contended, that
the sick should not be indulged with fresh air, have at
length discovered, that it may do them good. It is
therefore to be hoped, that they may in time discover
likewise, that it is not hurtful to those who are in
health, and that we may be then cured of the <em>aërophobia</em>,
that at present distresses weak minds, and make
them choose to be stifled and poisoned, rather than
leave open the window of a bed-chamber, or put down
the glass of a coach.</p>

<p>Confined air, when saturated with perspirable matter<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>,
will not receive more; and that matter must
remain in our bodies, and occasion diseases: but it
gives some previous notice of its being about to be
hurtful, by producing certain uneasinesses, slight indeed
at first, such as, with regard to the lungs, is a trifling
sensation, and to the pores of the skin a kind of restlessness,
which is difficult to describe, and few that feel
it know the cause of it. But we may recollect, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
sometimes, on waking in the night, we have, if warmly
covered, found it difficult to get asleep again. We turn
often without finding repose in any position. This
figettiness, to use a vulgar expression for want of a better,
is occasioned wholly by an uneasiness in the skin,
owing to the retension of the perspirable matter&mdash;the
bed-clothes having received their quantity, and, being
saturated, refusing to take any more. To become sensible
of this by an experiment, let a person keep his
position in the bed, but throw off the bed-clothes, and
suffer fresh air to approach the part uncovered of his
body; he will then feel that part suddenly refreshed;
for the air will immediately relieve the skin, by receiving,
licking up, and carrying off, the load of perspirable
matter that incommoded it. For every portion of cool
air, that approaches the warm skin, in receiving its part
of that vapour, receives therewith a degree of heat, that
rarifies and renders it lighter, when it will be pushed
away, with its burthen, by cooler and therefore heavier
fresh air; which, for a moment, supplies its place, and
then, being likewise changed and warmed, gives way to
a succeeding quantity. This is the order of nature, to
prevent animals being infected by their own perspiration.
He will now be sensible of the difference between
the part exposed to the air, and that which,
remaining sunk in the bed, denies the air access: for
this part now manifests its uneasiness more distinctly
by the comparison, and the seat of the uneasiness is
more plainly perceived, than when the whole surface
of the body was affected by it.</p>

<p>Here, then, is one great and general cause of unpleasing
dreams. For when the body is uneasy, the mind
will be disturbed by it, and disagreeable ideas of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
various kinds will, in sleep, be the natural consequences.
The remedies, preventative and curative,
follow:</p>

<p>1. By eating moderately (as before advised for
health's sake) less perspirable matter is produced in a
given time; hence the bed-clothes receive it longer
before they are saturated; and we may, therefore, sleep
longer, before we are made uneasy by their refusing to
receive any more.</p>

<p>2. By using thinner and more porous bed-clothes,
which will suffer the perspirable matter more easily to
pass through them, we are less incommoded, such being
longer tolerable.</p>

<p>3. When you are awakened by this uneasiness, and
find you cannot easily sleep again, get out of bed, beat
up and turn your pillow, shake the bed-clothes well,
with at least twenty shakes, then throw the bed open,
and leave it to cool; in the meanwhile, continuing undrest,
walk about your chamber, till your skin has had
time to discharge its load, which it will do sooner as
the air may be drier and colder. When you begin to
feel the cold air unpleasant, then return to your bed,
and you will soon fall asleep, and your sleep will be
sweet and pleasant. All the scenes presented to your
fancy will be of the pleasing kind. I am often as
agreeably entertained with them, as by the scenery of
an opera. If you happen to be too indolent to get out
of bed, you may, instead of it, lift up your bed-clothes
with one arm and leg, so as to draw in a good deal of
fresh air, and, by letting them fall, force it out again.
This, repeated twenty times, will so clear them of the
perspirable matter they have imbibed, as to permit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
your sleeping well for some time afterwards. But this
latter method is not equal to the former.</p>

<p>Those who do not love trouble, and can afford to
have two beds, will find great luxury in rising, when
they wake in a hot bed, and going into the cool one.
Such shifting of beds would also be of great service to
persons ill of a fever, as it refreshes and frequently procures
sleep. A very large bed, that will admit a removal
so distant from the first situation as to be cool and
sweet, may in a degree answer the same end.</p>

<p>One or two observations more will conclude this little
piece. Care must be taken when you lie down, to
dispose your pillow so as to suit your manner of
placing your head, and to be perfectly easy; then place
your limbs so as not to bear inconveniently hard upon
one another, as, for instance, the joints of your ancles:
for though a bad position may at first give but little
pain and be hardly noticed, yet a continuance will
render it less tolerable, and the uneasiness may come
on while you are asleep, and disturb your imagination.</p>

<p>These are the rules of the art. But though they will
generally prove effectual in producing the end intended,
there is a case in which the most punctual observance
of them will be totally fruitless. I need not
mention the case to you, my dear friend, but my
account of the art would be imperfect without it. The
case is, when the person, who desires to have pleasant
dreams, has not taken care to preserve, what is necessary
above all things,</p>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Midnight, October 22</em>, 1780.</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;Eh! Oh! Eh! What have I done to merit
these cruel sufferings?</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;Many things; you have ate and drank too
freely, and too much indulged those legs of yours in
their indolence.</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;Who is it that accuses me?</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;It is I, even I, the gout.</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;What! my enemy in person?</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;No, not your enemy.</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;I repeat it; my enemy: for you would
not only torment my body to death, but ruin my good
name: you reproach me as a glutton and a tipler; now
all the world that knows me will allow, that I am neither
the one nor the other.</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;The world may think as it pleases: it is
always very complaisant to itself, and sometimes to its
friends; but I very well know, that the quantity of meat
and drink proper for a man, who takes a reasonable degree
of exercise, would be too much for another, who
never takes any.</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;I take&mdash;Eh! Oh!&mdash;as much exercise&mdash;Eh!&mdash;as
I can, Madam Gout. You know my sedentary
state, and on that account, it would seem, Madam
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
Gout, as if you might spare me a little, seeing it is not
altogether my own fault.</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;Not a jot: your rhetoric and your politeness
are thrown away; your apology avails nothing. If
your situation in life is a sedentary one, your amusements,
your recreations, at least, should be active. You
ought to walk or ride; or, if the weather prevents that,
play at billiards. But let us examine your course of
life. While the mornings are long, and you have leisure
to go abroad, what do you do? Why, instead of
gaining an appetite for breakfast, by salutary exercise,
you amuse yourself with books, pamphlets, or newspapers,
which commonly are not worth the reading. Yet
you eat an inordinate breakfast, four dishes of tea, with
cream, and one or two buttered toasts, with slices of
hung beef, which I fancy are not things the most
easily digested. Immediately afterward you sit down
to write at your desk, or converse with persons who
apply to you on business. Thus the time passes till
one, without any kind of bodily exercise. But all this
I could pardon, in regard, as you say, to your sedentary
condition. But what is your practice after dinner.
Walking in the beautiful gardens of those friends with
whom you have dined would be the choice of men of
sense: yours is to be fixed down to chess, where you
are found engaged for two or three hours! This is your
perpetual recreation, which is the least eligible of any
for a sedentary man, because, instead of accelerating
the motion of the fluids, the rigid attention it requires
helps to retard the circulation and obstruct internal
secretions. Wrapt in the speculations of this wretched
game, you destroy your constitution. What can
be expected from such a course of living, but a body
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
replete with stagnant humours, ready to fall a prey to
all kinds of dangerous maladies, if I, the gout, did not
occasionally bring you relief by agitating these humours,
and so purifying or dissipating them. If it was
in some nook or alley in Paris, deprived of walks, that
you played awhile at chess after dinner, this might be
excusable, but the same taste prevails with you in
Passey, Auteuil, Montmartre, or Sanoy, places where
there are the finest gardens and walks, a pure air, beautiful
women, and most agreeable and instructive conversation;
all which you might enjoy by frequenting
the walks! But these are rejected for this abominable
game of chess. Fie, then, Mr. Franklin! But amidst
my instructions, I had almost forgot to administer my
wholsome corrections: so take that twinge&mdash;and that.</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;Oh! Eh! Oh!&mdash;Ohhh! As much instruction
as you please, Madam Gout, and as many
reproaches, but pray, Madam, a truce with your corrections!</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;No, sir, no&mdash;I will not abate a particle of
what is so much for your good&mdash;therefore&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;Oh! Ehhh!&mdash;It is not fair to say I take
no exercise, when I do very often, going out to dine,
and returning in my carriage.</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;That of all imaginable exercise is the most
slight and insignificant, if you allude to the motion of a
carriage suspended on springs. By observing the
degree of heat obtained by different kinds of motion
we may form an estimate of the quantity of exercise
given by each. Thus, for example, if you turn out to
walk in winter with cold feet, in an hour's time you
will be in a glow all over; ride on horseback, the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
effect will scarcely be perceived by four hours round
trotting: but if you loll in a carriage, such as you have
mentioned, you may travel all day, and gladly enter the
last inn to warm your feet by a fire. Flatter yourself
then no longer, that half an hour's airing in your carriage
deserves the name of exercise. Providence has
appointed few to roll in carriages, while he has given
to all a pair of legs, which are machines infinitely more
commodious and serviceable. Be grateful, then, and
make a proper use of yours. Would you know, how
they forward the circulation of your fluids, in the very
action of transporting you from place to place? observe
when you walk, that all your weight is alternately
thrown from one leg to the other; this occasions a
great pressure on the vessels of the foot, and repels
their contents. When relieved, by the weight being
thrown on the other foot, the vessels of the first are
allowed to replenish, and by a return of this weight,
this repulsion again succeeds; thus accelerating the
circulation of the blood. The heat produced in any
given time depends on the degree of this acceleration:
the fluids are shaken, the humours attenuated, the
secretions facilitated, and all goes well; the cheeks are
ruddy, and health is established. Behold your fair
friend at Auteuil: a lady who received from bounteous
nature more really useful science, than half a dozen such
pretenders to philosophy, as you, have been able to
extract from all your books. When she honours you
with a visit, it is on foot. She walks all hours of the
day, and leaves indolence and its concomitant maladies
to be endured by her horses. In this see at once
the preservative of her health and personal charms.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
But you, when you go to Auteuil, must have your carriage,
though it is no farther from Passy to Auteuil,
than from Auteuil to Passy.</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;Your reasonings grow very tiresome.</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;I stand corrected. I will be silent and continue
my office: take that, and that.</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;Oh! Ohh! Talk on, I pray you!</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;No, no; I have a good number of twinges
for you to-night, and you may be sure of some more
to-morrow.</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;What, with such a fever! I shall go distracted.
Oh! Eh! Can no one bear it for me?</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;Ask that of your horses; they have served
you faithfully.</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;How can you so cruelly sport with my
torments?</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;Sport? I am very serious. I have here a
list of your offences against your own health distinctly
written, and can justify every stroke inflicted on you.</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;Read it then.</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;It is too long a detail; but I will briefly
mention some particulars.</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;Proceed&mdash;I am all attention.</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;Do you remember how often you have promised
yourself, the following morning, a walk in the
grove of Boulogne, in the garden de la Muette, or in
your own garden, and have violated your promise,
alledging, at one time, it was too cold, at another too
warm, too windy, too moist, or what else you pleased;
when in truth it was too nothing, but your insuperable
love of ease?</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;That I confess may have happened occasionally,
probably ten times in a year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;Your confession is very far short of the truth;
the gross amount is one hundred and ninety-nine times.</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;Is it possible?</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;So possible that it is fact; you may rely on
the accuracy of my statement. You know Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;'s
gardens, and what fine walks they contain; you know
the handsome flight of an hundred steps, which lead
from the terrace above to the lawn below. You have
been in the practice of visiting this amiable family
twice a week after dinner, and as it is a maxim of your
own, that "a man may take as much exercise in walking
a mile up and down stairs, as in ten on level
ground," what an opportunity was here for you to
have had exercise in both these ways? Did you embrace
it, and how often?</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;I cannot immediately answer that question.</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;I will do it for you; not once.</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;Not once?</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;Even so. During the summer you went
there at six o'clock. You found the charming lady,
with her lovely children and friends, eager to walk with
you, and entertain you with their agreeable conversation:
and what has been your choice? Why to sit on
the terrace, satisfying yourself with the fine prospect,
and passing your eye over the beauties of the garden
below, without taking one step to descend and walk
about in them. On the contrary, you call for tea, and
the chess-board; and lo! you are occupied in your
seat till nine o'clock, and that beside two hours play
after dinner; and then, instead of walking home, which
would have bestirred you a little, you step into your
carriage. How absurd to suppose, that all this carelessness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
can be reconcileable with health, without my
interposition!</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;I am convinced now of the justness of
poor Richard's remark, that, "Our debts and our sins
are always greater than we think for."</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;So it is! you philosophers are sages in your
maxims, and fools in your conduct.</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;But do you charge among my crimes,
that I return in a carriage from Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;'s?</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;Certainly: for having been seated all the
while, you cannot object the fatigue of the day, and
cannot want therefore the relief of a carriage.</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;What then would you have me do with
my carriage?</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;Burn it, if you choose; you would at least
get heat out of it once in this way; or if you dislike
that proposal, here's another for you: observe the poor
peasants who work in the vineyards and grounds about
the villages of Passy, Anteuil, Chaillois, &amp;c.; you may
find every day among these deserving creatures, four or
five old men and women, bent and perhaps crippled by
weight of years, and too long and too great labour.
After a most fatiguing day, these people have to trudge
a mile or two to their smoky huts. Order your coachmen
to set them down. That is an act that will be
good for your soul; and at the same time, after your
visit to the B&mdash;&mdash;'s, if you return on foot, that will be
good for your body.</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;Ah! how tiresome you are.</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;Well then, to my office; it should not be
forgotten, that I am your physician. There.</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;Ohhh! what a devil of a physician!</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;How ungrateful are you to say so! Is it not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
I, who, in the character of your physician, have saved
you from the palsy, dropsy, and apoplexy? one or other
of which would have done for you long ago, but for me.</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;I submit, and thank you for the past, but
intreat the discontinuance of your visits for the future:
for in my mind one had better die, than be cured so
dolefully. Permit me just to hint, that I have also not
been unfriendly to <em>you</em>. I never feed physician, or
quack of any kind, to enter the list against you; if then
you do not leave me to my repose, it may be said you
are ungrateful too.</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;I can scarcely acknowledge that as any objection.
As to quacks, I despise them: they may kill
you, indeed, but cannot injure me. And as to regular
physicians, they are at last convinced, that the gout, in
such a subject as you are, is no disease, but a remedy;
and wherefore cure a remedy?&mdash;but to our business&mdash;There.&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Franklin.</em>&mdash;Oh! Oh!&mdash;for heaven's sake leave me;
and I promise faithfully never more to play at chess,
but to take exercise daily, and live temperately.</p>

<p><em>Gout.</em>&mdash;I know you too well. You promise fair;
but, after a few months of good health, you will return
to your old habits; your fine promises will be forgotten
like the forms of the last year's clouds. Let us then
finish the account and I will go. But I leave you with
an assurance, of visiting you again at a proper time and
place; for my object is your good, and you are sensible
now, that I am your real friend.</p>

<p>I condole with you. We have lost a most dear
and valuable relation<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>. But it is the will of God and
nature, that these mortal bodies be laid aside, when the
soul is to enter into real life. This is rather an embryo
state, a preparation for living. A man is not completely
born until he be dead. Why then should we
grieve, that a new child is born among the immortals, a
new member added to their happy society? We are
spirits. That bodies should be lent us, while they can
afford us pleasure, assist us in acquiring knowledge, or
doing good to our fellow-creatures, is a kind and benevolent
act of God. When they become unfit for
these purposes, and afford us pain instead of pleasure,
instead of an aid become an incumbrance, and answer
none of the intentions for which they were given, it is
equally kind and benevolent, that a way is provided by
which we may get rid of them. Death is that way.
We ourselves, in some cases, prudently choose a partial
death. A mangled painful limb, which cannot be
restored, we willingly cut off. He, who plucks out a
tooth, parts with it freely, since the pain goes with it:
and he, who quits the whole body, parts at once with
all pains, and possibilities of pains and diseases, it was
liable to, or capable of making him suffer.</p>

<p>Our friend and we were invited abroad on a party of
pleasure, which is to last for ever. His chair was ready
first, and he is gone before us. We could not all conveniently
start together: and why should you and I be
grieved at this, since we are soon to follow, and know
where to find him?</p>

<p>You may remember, my dear friend, that when
we lately spent that happy day, in the delightful garden
and sweet society of the Moulin Joly, I stopt a little in
one of our walks, and staid some time behind the company.
We had been shown numberless skeletons of a
kind of little fly, called an ephemera, whose successive
generations, we were told, were bred and expired within
the day. I happened to see a living company of them
on a leaf, who appeared to be engaged in conversation.
You know I understand all the inferior animal tongues:
my too great application to the study of them is the
best excuse I can give for the little progress I have
made in your charming language. I listened through
curiosity to the discourse of these little creatures; but
as they, in their national vivacity, spoke three or four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
together, I could make but little of their conversation.
I found, however, by some broken expressions that I
heard now and then, they were disputing warmly on
the merit of two foreign musicians, one a <em>cousin</em>, the
other a <em>muscheto</em>; in which dispute they spent their
time, seemingly as regardless of the shortness of life, as
if they had been sure of living a month. Happy people!
thought I, you live certainly under a wise, just, and
mild government, since you have no public grievances
to complain of, nor any subject of contention, but the
perfections or imperfections of foreign music. I turned
my head from them to an old grey-headed one, who
was single on another leaf, and talking to himself.
Being amused with his soliloquy, I put it down in writing,
in hopes it will likewise amuse her to whom I am
so much indebted for the most pleasing of all amusements,
her delicious company, and heavenly harmony.</p>

<p>"It was," says he, "the opinion of learned philosophers
of our race, who lived and flourished long before
my time, that this vast world, the Moulin Joly, could not
itself subsist more than eighteen hours: and I think
there was some foundation for that opinion; since, by
the apparent motion of the great luminary, that gives
life to all nature, and which in my time has evidently
declined considerably towards the ocean at the end of
our earth, it must then finish its course, be extinguished
in the waters that surround us, and leave the world in
cold and darkness, necessarily producing universal
death and destruction. I have lived seven of those
hours; a great age, being no less than four hundred
and twenty minutes of time. How very few of us continue
so long? I have seen generations born, flourish,
and expire. My present friends are the children and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
grand-children of the friends of my youth, who are
now, alas no more! And I must soon follow them; for,
by the course of nature, though still in health, I cannot
expect to live above seven or eight minutes longer.
What now avails all my toil and labour, in amassing
honey-dew on this leaf, which I cannot live to enjoy!
What the political struggles I have been engaged in,
for the good of my com-patriot inhabitants of this bush,
or my philosophical studies, for the benefit of our race
in general! for in politics (what can laws do without
morals?) our present race of ephemeræ will in a course
of minutes become corrupt, like those of other and
older bushes, and consequently as wretched: and in
philosophy how small our progress! Alas! art is long,
and life is short! My friends would comfort me with
the idea of a name, they say, I shall leave behind me;
and they tell me, I have lived long enough to nature
and to glory. But what will fame be to an ephemera,
who no longer exists? and what will become of all history
in the eighteenth hour, when the world itself, even
the whole Moulin Joly, shall come to its end, and
be buried in universal ruin?"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>To me, after all my eager pursuits, no solid pleasures
now remain, but the reflection of a long life spent in
meaning well, the sensible conversation of a few good
lady ephemeræ, and now and then a kind smile and a
tune from the ever amiable Brilliant.</p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Understanding that an account of our dear
departed friend, Mr. Peter Collinson, is intended to be
given to the public, I cannot omit expressing my approbation
of the design. The characters of good men
are exemplary, and often stimulate the well disposed to
an imitation, beneficial to mankind, and honourable to
themselves. And as you may be unacquainted with
the following instances of his zeal and usefulness in
promoting knowledge, which fell within my observation,
I take the liberty of informing you, that in 1730,
a subscription library being set on foot at Philadelphia,
he encouraged the design by making several very valuable
presents to it, and procuring others from his
friends: and as the library company had a considerable
sum arising annually to be laid out in books, and needed
a judicious friend in London to transact the business
for them, he voluntarily and cheerfully undertook that
service, and executed it for more than thirty years successively,
assisting in the choice of books, and taking
the whole care of collecting and shipping them, without
ever charging or accepting any consideration for
his trouble. The success of this library (greatly owing
to his kind countenance and good advice) encouraged
the erecting others in different places on the same plan;
and it is supposed, there are now upwards of thirty subsisting
in the several colonies, which have contributed
greatly to the spreading of useful knowledge in that
part of the world; the books he recommended being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
all of that kind, and the catalogue of this first library
being much respected and followed by those libraries
that succeeded.</p>

<p>During the same time he transmitted to the directors
of the library the earliest accounts of every new European
improvement in agriculture and the arts, and every
philosophical discovery; among which, in 1745, he
sent over an account of the new German experiments
in electricity, together with a glass tube, and some directions
for using it so as to repeat those experiments.
This was the first notice I had of that curious subject,
which I afterwards prosecuted with some diligence,
being encouraged by the friendly reception he gave to
the letters I wrote to him upon it. Please to accept
this small testimony of mine to his memory, for which
I shall ever have the utmost respect; and believe me,
with sincere esteem, dear sir,</p>

<p class="negidt1">To all captains and commanders of armed ships, acting
by commission from the congress of the United
States of America, now in war with Great Britain.</p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Gentlemen,</p>

<p>A ship having been fitted out from England, before
the commencement of this war, to make discoveries of
new countries in unknown seas, under the conduct of
that most celebrated navigator, Captain Cook,&mdash;an undertaking
truly laudable in itself, as the increase of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
geographical knowledge facilitates the communication
between distant nations, in the exchange of useful products
and manufactures, and the extension of arts
whereby the common enjoyments of human life are
multiplied and augmented, and science of other kinds
increased, to the benefit of mankind in general.&mdash;This
is therefore most earnestly to recommend to every one
of you, that in case the said ship, which is now expected
to be soon in the European seas on her return, should
happen to fall into your hands, you would not consider
her as an enemy, nor suffer any plunder to be made of
the effects contained in her, nor obstruct her immediate
return to England, by detaining her or sending her into
any other part of Europe or America, but that you
would treat the said captain Cook and his people with
all civility and kindness, affording them, as common
friends to mankind, all the assistance in your power,
which they may happen to stand in need of. In so
doing, you will not only gratify the generosity of your
own dispositions, but there is no doubt of your obtaining
the approbation of the congress<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>, and your own

<p><a name="Footnote_194_194" id="Footnote_194_194"></a><a href="#FNanchor_194_194"><span class="label">[194]</span></a> Dr. Kippis, in his Life of Captain Cook, had asserted, upon what he
deemed unquestionable authority, that Dr. Franklin's orders were instantly
reversed, and that it was directed by congress, to seize captain Cook, if
an opportunity of doing it occurred: but, finding that the information was
false, he addressed a letter to the editor of the Gentleman's Magazine, in
September, 1795, publicly acknowledging his mistake.
</p>
<p>
In the American Museum, from which we have taken Dr. Franklin's
letter, the correspondent who communicated the letter says, that "the generous
proceeding of Dr. Franklin in writing it was so well known in England,
and the sentiments it manifested so much approved by the government
there, that, when Cook's Voyage was printed, the admiralty sent to Dr.
Franklin a copy of the same in three volumes quarto, accompanied with
the elegant collection of plates, and a very polite letter from lord Howe,
signifying, that the present was made with his majesty's express approbation;
and the royal society having, in honour of that illustrious navigator,
one of their members, struck some gold medals to be distributed among his
friends and the friends of his voyage, one of those medals, was also sent to
Dr. Franklin, by order of the society, together with a letter from their
worthy president, sir Joseph Banks, expressing likewise, that it was sent
with the approbation of his majesty." <em>Editor.</em></p></div></div>

of free Negroes, unlawfully held in Bondage.</em></a><a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></h3>

<p>It is with peculiar satisfaction, we assure the friends
of humanity, that, in prosecuting the design of our
association, our endeavours have proved successful, far
beyond our most sanguine expectations.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this success, and by the daily progress
of that luminous and benign spirit of liberty,
which is diffusing itself throughout the world, and humbly
hoping for the continuance of the divine blessing
on our labours, we have ventured to make an important
addition to our original plan, and do, therefore, earnestly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
solicit the support and assistance of all, who can
feel the tender emotions of sympathy and compassion,
or relish the exalted pleasure of beneficence.</p>

<p>Slavery is such an atrocious debasement of human
nature, that its very extirpation, if not performed with
solicitous care, may sometimes open a source of serious
evils.</p>

<p>The unhappy man, who has long been treated as a
brute animal, too frequently sinks beneath the common
standard of the human species. The galling chains,
that bind his body, do also fetter his intellectual faculties,
and impair the social affections of his heart. Accustomed
to move like a mere machine, by the will of
a master, reflection is suspended; he has not the power
of choice; and reason and conscience have but little influence
over his conduct, because he is chiefly governed
by the passion of fear. He is poor and friendless&mdash;perhaps
worn out by extreme labour, age, and disease.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, freedom may often prove
a misfortune to himself, and prejudicial to society.</p>

<p>Attention to emancipated black people, it is therefore
to be hoped, will become a branch of our national
police; but as far as we contribute to promote this
emancipation, so far that attention is evidently a serious
duty incumbent on us, and which we mean to discharge
to the best of our judgment and abilities.</p>

<p>To instruct, to advise, to qualify those, who have been
restored to freedom, for the exercise and enjoyment of
civil liberty, to promote in them habits of industry, to
furnish them with employments suited to their age, sex,
talents, and other circumstances, and to procure their
children an education calculated for their future situation
in life; these are the great outlines of the annexed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
plan, which we have adopted, and which we conceive
will essentially promote the public good, and the happiness
of these our hitherto too much neglected fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>A plan so extensive cannot be carried into execution
without considerable pecuniary resources, beyond the
present ordinary funds of the society. We hope much
from the generosity of enlightened and benevolent freemen,
and will gratefully receive any donations or subscriptions
for this purpose, which may be made to our
treasurer, James Starr, or to James Pemberton, chairman
of our committee of correspondence.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Plan for improving the Condition of the Free Blacks.</em></a></h3>

<p>The business relative to free blacks shall be transacted
by a committee of twenty-four persons, annually
elected by ballot, at the meeting of this society, in the
month called April; and in order to perform the different
services with expedition, regularity, and energy,
this committee shall resolve itself into the following
sub-committees, viz:</p>

<p class="center">I.</p>

<p>A committee of inspection, who shall superintend the
morals, general conduct, and ordinary situation of the
free negroes, and afford them advice and instruction,
protection from wrongs, and other friendly offices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">II.</p>

<p>A committee of guardians, who shall place out children
and young people with suitable persons, that they
may (during a moderate time of apprenticeship, or servitude)
learn some trade or other business of subsistence.
The committee may effect this partly by a persuasive
influence on parents and the persons concerned;
and partly by co-operating with the laws, which are, or
may be enacted for this, and similar purposes: in forming
contracts on these occasions, the committee shall
secure to the society, as far as may be practicable, the
right of guardianship over the persons so bound.</p>

<p class="center">III.</p>

<p>A committee of education, who shall superintend the
school-instruction of the children and youth of the free
blacks; they may either influence them to attend regularly
the schools, already established in this city, or
form others with this view; they shall, in either case,
provide, that the pupils may receive such learning, as
is necessary for their future situation in life; and especially
a deep impression of the most important, and generally
acknowledged moral and religious principles.
They shall also procure and preserve a regular record
of the marriages, births, and manumissions of all free
blacks.</p>

<p class="center">IV.</p>

<p>A committee of employ, who shall endeavour to procure
constant employment for those free negroes who
are able to work: as the want of this would occasion
poverty, idleness, and many vicious habits. This committee
will, by sedulous enquiry, be enabled to find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
common labour for a great number; they will also provide,
that such, as indicate proper talents, may learn
various trades, which may be done by prevailing upon
them to bind themselves for such a term of years, as
shall compensate their masters for the expence and
trouble of instruction and maintenance. The committee
may attempt the institution of some useful and
simple manufactures, which require but little skill, and
also may assist, in commencing business, such as appear
to be qualified for it.</p>

<p>Whenever the committee of inspection shall find
persons of any particular description requiring attention,
they shall immediately direct them to the committee,
of whose care they are the proper objects.</p>

<p>In matters of a mixed nature, the committees shall
confer, and, if necessary, act in concert. Affairs of
great importance shall be referred to the whole committee.</p>

<p>The expence, incurred by the prosecution of this
plan, shall be defrayed by a fund, to be formed by donations,
or subscriptions, for these particular purposes,
and to be kept separate from the other funds of this
society.</p>

<p>The committee shall make a report of their proceedings,
and of the state of their stock, to the society, at
their quarterly meetings, in the months called April
and October.</p>

remark on our nation, viz. The English <em>feel</em>, but they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
do not <em>see</em>. That is, they are sensible of inconveniences
when they are present, but do not take sufficient care
to prevent them: their natural courage makes them
too little apprehensive of danger, so that they are often
surprised by it, unprovided of the proper means of
security. When it is too late, they are sensible of their
imprudence: after great fires, they provide buckets and
engines: after a pestilence, they think of keeping clean
their streets and common sewers: and when a town has
been sacked by their enemies, they provide for its
defence, &amp;c. This kind of <em>after-wisdom</em> is indeed so
common with us, as to occasion the vulgar, though
very insignificant saying, <em>When the steed is stolen, you
shut the stable door</em>.</p>

<p>But the more insensible we generally are of public
danger and indifferent when warned of it, so much the
more freely, openly, and earnestly, ought such as apprehend
it to speak their sentiments; that, if possible,
those who seem to sleep may be awakened, to think of
some means of avoiding or preventing the mischief,
before it be too late.</p>

<p>Believing therefore, that it is my <em>duty</em>, I shall honestly
speak my mind in the following paper.</p>

<p>War, at this time, rages over a great part of the
known world; our newspapers are weekly filled with
fresh accounts of the destruction it every where occasions.
Pensylvania, indeed, situate in the centre of
the colonies, has hitherto enjoyed profound repose; and
though our nation is engaged in a bloody war, with two
great and powerful kingdoms, yet, defended, in a great
degree, from the French, on the one hand, by the
northern provinces, and from the Spaniards, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
other, by the southern, at no small expence to each, our
people have, till lately, slept securely in their habitations.</p>

<p>There is no British colony, excepting this, but has
made some kind of provision for its defence; many of
them have therefore never been attempted by an enemy;
and others, that were attacked, have generally
defended themselves with success. The length and
difficulty of our bay and river have been thought so
effectual a security to us, that hitherto no means have
been entered into, that might discourage an attempt
upon us, or prevent its succeeding.</p>

<p>But whatever security this might have been while
both country and city were poor, and the advantage to
be expected scarce worth the hazard of an attempt, it
is now doubted, whether we can any longer safely
depend upon it. Our wealth, of late years much encreased,
is one strong temptation, our defenceless state
another, to induce an enemy to attack us; while the
acquaintance they have lately gained with our Bay and
river, by means of the prisoners and flags of truce they
have had among us; by spies which they almost every
where maintain, and perhaps from traitors among ourselves;
with the facility of getting pilots to conduct
them; and the known absence of ships of war, during the
greatest part of the year, from both Virginia and New
York, ever since the war began, render the appearance
of success to the enemy far more promising, and therefore
highly encrease our danger.</p>

<p>That our enemies may have spies abroad, and some
even in these colonies, will not be made much doubt of,
when it is considered, that such has been the practice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
of all nations in all ages, whenever they were engaged,
or intended to engage, in war. Of this we have an early
example in the book of Judges (too pertinent to our case,
and therefore I must beg leave a little to enlarge upon
it) where we are told, <em>Chap.</em> xviii, v. 2. That <em>the
children of Dan sent of their family five men from their
coasts to spie out the land, and search it, saying, Go,
search the land</em>. These Danites it seems were at this time
not very orthodox in their religion, and their spies met
with a certain idolatrous priest of their own persuasion,
v. 3, and they said to him, <em>Who brought thee hither?
What makest thou in this place? And what hast thou
here?</em> [Would to God no such priests were to be found
among us]. And they said unto him, v. 5. <em>Ask counsel
of God, that we may know, whether our way which we go
shall be prosperous: and the priest said unto them, Go in
peace; before the Lord is your way wherein you go.</em> [Are
there no priests among us, think you, that might, in
the like case, give an enemy as good encouragement?
It is well known, that we have numbers of the same
religion with those, who of late encouraged the French
to invade our Mother Country.] <em>And they came</em>, verse
7, <em>to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how
they dwelt</em> <span class="xs lsp2">CARELESS</span>, <em>after the manner of the Zidonians</em>,
<span class="xs lsp2">QUIET</span> <em>and</em> <span class="xs lsp2">SECURE</span>. They <em>thought</em> themselves
secure, no doubt; and as they <em>never had been</em> disturbed,
vainly imagined they <em>never should</em>. It is not unlikely,
that some might see the danger they were exposed to
by living in that <em>careless</em> manner; but that, if these publicly
expressed their apprehensions, the rest reproached
them as timorous persons, wanting courage or confidence
in their gods, who (they might say) had hitherto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
protected them. But the spies, verse 8, returned, and
said to their countrymen, verse 9, <em>Arise, that we may
go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold
it is very good! And are ye still? Be not slothful to go.</em>
Verse 10, <em>when ye go, ye shall come to a people</em> <span class="xs lsp2">SECURE</span>;
[that is, a people that apprehend no danger, and therefore
have made no provision against it; great encouragement
this!] <em>and to a large land, and a place where
there is no want of any thing</em>. What could they desire
more? Accordingly we find, in the following verses,
that <em>six hundred men</em> only, <em>appointed with weapons of
war</em>, undertook the conquest of this <em>large land</em>; knowing
that 600 men, armed and disciplined, would be an
over-match perhaps for 60,000, unarmed, undisciplined,
and off their guard. And when they went against
it, the idolatrous priest, verse 17, <em>with his graven image,
and his ephod, and his seraphim, and his molten image</em>,
[plenty of superstitious trinkets] joined with them, and,
no doubt, gave them all the intelligence and assistance
in his power; his heart, as the text assures us, <em>being
glad</em>, perhaps for reasons more than one. And now,
what was the fate of poor Laish! The 600 men being
arrived, found, as the spies had reported, a people
<span class="xs lsp2">QUIET</span> and <span class="xs lsp2">SECURE</span>, verse 20, 21, <em>And they smote them
with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with</em> <span class="xs lsp2">FIRE</span>;
<em>and there was no</em> <span class="xs lsp2">DELIVERER</span>, <em>because it was far from
Zidon</em>.&mdash;Not so far from Zidon, however, as Pensylvania
is from Britain; and yet we are, if possible, more
<em>careless</em> than the people of Laish! As the scriptures are
given for our reproof, instruction and warning, may
we make a due use of this example, before it be too late!</p>

<p>And is our <em>country</em>, any more than our city, altogether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
free from danger? Perhaps not. We have, it is
true, had a long peace with the Indians: but it is a long
peace indeed, as well as a long lane, that has no ending.
The French know the power and importance of
the Six Nations, and spare no artifice, pains or expence,
to gain them to their interest. By their priests
they have converted many to their religion, and these<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
have openly espoused their cause. The rest appear irresolute
what part to take; no persuasions, though enforced
with costly presents, having yet been able to
engage them generally on our side, though we had
numerous forces on their borders, ready to second and
support them. What then may be expected, now those
forces are, by orders from the crown, to be disbanded,
when our boasted expedition is laid aside, through want
(as it may appear to them) either of strength or courage;
when they see, that the French and their Indians,
boldly, and with impunity, ravage the frontiers of New
York, and scalp the inhabitants; when those few Indians,
that engaged with us against the French, are left
exposed to their resentment: when they consider these
things, is there no danger that, through disgust at our
usage, joined with fear of the French power, and greater
confidence in their promises and protection than in
ours, they may be wholly gained over by our enemies,
and join in the war against us? If such should be the
case, which God forbid, how soon may the mischief
spread to our frontier countries? And what may we
expect to be the consequence, but desertion of plantations,
ruin, bloodshed and confusion!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span></p>
<p>Perhaps some in the city, towns, and plantations
near the river, may say to themselves, "An Indian war
on the frontiers will not affect us; the enemy will never
come near our habitations; let those concerned take
care of themselves." And others who live in the country,
when they are told of the danger the city is in
from attempts by sea, may say, "What is that to us?
The enemy will be satisfied with the plunder of the
town, and never think it worth his while to visit our
plantations: let the town take care of itself."&mdash;These
are not mere suppositions, for I have heard some talk
in this strange manner. But are these the sentiments
of true Pensylvanians, of fellow-countrymen, or even
of men, that have common sense or goodness? Is not
the whole province one body, united by living under
the same laws, and enjoying the same privileges? Are
not the people of city and country connected as relations,
both by blood and marriage, and in friendships
equally dear? Are they not likewise united in interest,
and mutually useful and necessary to each other?
When the feet are wounded, shall the head say, it is
not me; I will not trouble myself to contrive relief! Or
if the head is in danger, shall the hands say, we are
not affected, and therefore will lend no assistance! No.
For so would the body be easily destroyed: but when
all parts join their endeavours for its security, it is often
preserved. And such should be the union between the
country and the town; and such their mutual endeavours
for the safety of the whole. When New England,
a distant colony, involved itself in a grievous debt
to reduce Cape Breton, we freely gave four thousand
pounds for <em>their</em> relief. And at another time, remembering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
that Great Britain, still more distant, groaned
under heavy taxes in supporting the war, we threw in
our mite to their assistance, by a free gift of three
thousand pounds: and shall country and town join in
helping strangers (as those comparatively are) and yet
refuse to assist each other?</p>

<p>But whatever different opinions we have of our security
in other respects, our <span class="xs lsp2">TRADE</span>, all seem to agree,
is in danger of being ruined in another year. The
great success of our enemies, in two different cruizes
this last summer in our bay, must give them the greatest
encouragement to repeat more frequently their
visits, the profit being almost certain, and the risk
next to nothing. Will not the first effect of this be,
an enhancing of the price of all foreign goods to the
tradesman and farmer, who use or consume them? For
the rate of insurance will increase, in proportion to the
hazard of importing them; and in the same proportion
will the price of those goods increase. If the price of
the tradesman's work, and the farmer's produce, would
increase equally with the price of foreign commodities,
the damage would not be so great: but the direct contrary
must happen. For the same hazard or rate of insurance,
that raises the price of what is imported, must
be deducted out of, and lower the price of what is exported.
Without this addition and deduction, as long
as the enemy cruize at our capes, and take those vessels
that attempt to <em>go out</em>, as well as those that endeavour
to <em>come in</em>, none can afford to trade, and business must
be soon at a stand. And will not the consequences be,
a discouragement of many of the vessels that used to
come from other places to purchase our produce, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
thereby a turning of the trade to ports that can be entered
with less danger, and capable of furnishing them
with the same commodities, as New York, &amp;c.; a lessening
of business to every shopkeeper, together with
multitudes of bad debts, the high rate of goods discouraging
the buyers, and the low rates of their labour
and produce, rendering them unable to pay for what they
had bought; loss of employment to the tradesman, and
bad pay for what little he does; and lastly, loss of many
inhabitants, who will retire to other provinces not subject
to the like inconveniences; whence a lowering of
the value of lands, lots, and houses.</p>

<p>The enemy, no doubt, have been told, that the people
of Pensylvania are Quakers, and against all defence,
from a principle of conscience; this, though true of a
part, and that a small part only of the inhabitants, is
commonly said of the whole; and what may make it
look probable to strangers is, that in fact, nothing is
done by any part of the people towards their defence.
But to refuse defending one's self, or one's country, is
so unusual a thing among mankind, that possibly they
may not believe it, till by experience, they find they
can come higher and higher up our river, seize our vessels,
land and plunder our plantations and villages, and
retire with their booty unmolested. Will not this confirm
the report, and give them the greatest encouragement
to strike one bold stroke for the city, and for the
whole plunder of the river?</p>

<p>It is said by some, that the expence of a vessel, to
guard our trade, would be very heavy, greater than
perhaps all the enemy can be supposed to take from us
at sea would amount to; and that it would be cheaper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
for the government to open an insurance office, and
pay all losses. But is this right reasoning? I think not;
for what the enemy takes is clear loss to us, and gain
to him; increasing his riches and strength, as much as
it diminishes ours, so making the difference double;
whereas the money, paid our own tradesmen for building
and fitting out a vessel of defence, remains in the
country, and circulates among us; what is paid to the
officers and seamen, that navigate her, is also spent
ashore, and soon gets into other hands; the farmer receives
the money for her provisions, and, on the whole,
nothing is clearly lost to the country but her wear and
tear, or so much as she sells for at the end of the war
less than her first cost. This loss, and a trifling one it
is, is all the inconvenience; but how many and how
great are the conveniences and advantages! and should
the enemy, through our supineness and neglect to provide
for the defence both of our trade and country, be
encouraged to attempt this city, and after plundering
us of our goods, either <em>burn it</em>, or put it to ransom, how
great would that loss be! besides the confusion, terror,
and distress, so many hundreds of families would be
involved in!</p>

<p>The thought of this latter circumstance so much
affects me, that I cannot forbear expatiating somewhat
more upon it. You have, my dear countrymen and
fellow citizens, riches to tempt a considerable force to
unite and attack you, but are under no ties or engagements
to unite for your defence. Hence, on the first
alarm, <em>terror</em> will spread over all; and as no man can
with certainty depend that another will stand by him,
beyond doubt very many will seek safety by a speedy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
flight. Those, that are reputed rich, will flee, through
fear of torture, to make them produce more than they
are able. The man, that has a wife and children, will
find them hanging on his neck, beseeching him with
tears to quit the city, and save his life, to guide and
protect them in that time of general desolation and
ruin. All will run into confusion, amidst cries and lamentations,
and the hurry and disorder of departers,
carrying away their effects. The few that remain will
be unable to resist. <em>Sacking</em> the city will be the first,
and <em>burning</em> it, in all probability, the last act of the
enemy. This, I believe, will be the case, if you have
timely notice. But what must be your condition, if
suddenly surprized, without previous alarm, perhaps in
the night! Confined to your houses, you will have
nothing to trust to but the enemy's mercy. Your best
fortune will be, to fall under the power of commanders
of king's ships, able to controul the mariners; and not
into the hands of <em>licentious privateers</em>. Who can, without
the utmost horror, conceive the miseries of the
latter! when your persons, fortunes, wives, and daughters,
shall be subject to the wanton and unbridled rage,
rapine, and lust, of negroes, mulattoes, and others, the
vilest and most abandoned of mankind<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>. A dreadful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
scene! which some may represent as exaggerated. I
think it my duty to warn you: judge for yourselves.</p>

<p>It is true, with very little notice, the rich may shift
for themselves. The means of speedy flight are ready
in their hands; and with some previous care to lodge
money and effects in distant and secure places, though
they should lose much, yet enough may be left them,
and to spare. But most unhappily circumstanced indeed
are we, the middling people, the tradesmen,
shopkeepers, and farmers of this province and city!
We cannot all fly with our families; and if we could,
how shall we subsist? No; we and they, and what little
we have gained by hard labour and industry, must bear
the brunt: the weight of contributions, extorted by the
enemy (as it is of taxes among ourselves) must be surely
borne by us. Nor can it be avoided, as we stand at
present; for though we are numerous, we are quite defenceless,
having neither forts, arms, union, nor discipline.
And though it were true, that our trade might
be protected at no great expence, and our country and
our city easily defended, if proper measures were but
taken; yet, who shall take these measures? Who shall
pay that expence? On whom may we fix our eyes with
the least expectation, that they will do any thing for
our security? Should we address that wealthy and
powerful body of people, who have ever since the war
governed our elections, and filled almost every seat in
our assembly; should we intreat them to consider, if
not as friends, at least as legislators, that <em>protection</em> is as
truly due from the government to the people, as <em>obedience</em>
from the people to the government; and that if, on
account of their religious scruples, they themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
could do no act for our defence, yet they might retire,
relinquish their power for a season, quit the helm to
freer hands during the present tempest, to hands, chosen
by their own interest too, whose prudence and moderation,
with regard to them, they might safely confide
in; secure, from their own native strength, of resuming
again their present station, whenever it shall
please them: should we remind them, that the public
money, raised <em>from all</em>, belongs <em>to all</em>; that since they
have, for their own ease, and to secure themselves in
the quiet enjoyment of their religious principles (and
may they long enjoy them) expended such large sums
to oppose petitions, and engage favourable representations
of their conduct, if they themselves could by no
means be free to appropriate any part of the public
money for our defence; yet it would be no more than
justice, to spare us a reasonable sum for that purpose,
which they might easily give to the king's use as heretofore,
leaving all the appropriation to others, who
would faithfully apply it as we desired: should we tell
them, that though the treasury be at present empty, it
may soon be filled by the outstanding public debts collected;
or at least credit might be had for such a sum,
on a single vote of the assembly: that though <em>they</em>
themselves may be resigned and easy under this naked,
defenceless state of the country, it is far otherwise with
a very great part of the people; with <em>us</em>, who can have
no confidence that God will protect those, that neglect
the use of rational means for their security; nor have
any reason to hope, that our losses, if we should suffer
any, may be made up by collections in our favour at
home. Should we conjure them by all the ties of neighbourhood,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
friendship, justice, and humanity, to consider
these things; and what distraction, misery, and
confusion, what desolation and distress, may possibly
be the effect of their <em>unseasonable</em> predominancy and
perseverance; yet all would be in vain: for they have
already been, by great numbers of the people, petitioned
in vain. Our late governor did for years solicit, request,
and even threaten them in vain. The council
have since twice remonstrated to them in vain. Their
religious prepossessions are unchangeable, their obstinacy
invincible. Is there then the least hope remaining,
that from that quarter any thing should arise for
our security?</p>

<p>And is our prospect better, if we turn our eyes to the
strength of the opposite party, those great and rich men,
merchants and others, who are ever railing at Quakers
for doing what their principles seem to require, and
what in charity we ought to believe they think their
duty, but take no one step themselves for the public
safety. They have so much wealth and influence, if
they would use it, that they might easily, by their endeavours
and example, raise a military spirit among us,
make us fond, studious of, and expert in, martial discipline,
and affect every thing that is necessary, under
God, for our protection. But <em>envy</em> seems to have
taken possession of their hearts, and to have eaten out
and destroyed every generous, noble, public-spirited <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'sentimeat'">sentiment</ins>.
<em>Rage</em> at the disappointment of their little
schemes for power, gnaws their souls, and fills them
with such cordial hatred to their opponents, that every
proposal, by the execution of which <em>those</em> may receive
benefit as well as themselves, is rejected with indignation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
"What," say they, "shall we lay out our money
to protect the trade of Quakers? Shall we fight to defend
Quakers? No; let the trade perish, and the city
burn; let what will happen, we shall never lift a finger
to prevent it." Yet the Quakers have <em>conscience</em> to plead
for their resolution not to fight, which these gentlemen
have not. Conscience with you, gentlemen, is on the
other side of the question: conscience enjoins it as a
<em>duty</em> on you (and indeed I think it such on every
man) to defend your country, your friends, your aged
parents, your wives, and helpless children: and yet you
resolve not to perform this duty, but act contrary to
your own consciences, because the Quakers act according
to theirs. Till of late, I could scarce believe the
story of him, who refused to pump in a sinking ship,
because one on board, whom he hated, would be saved
by it as well as himself. But such, it seems, is the unhappiness
of human nature, that our passions, when
violent, often are too hard for the united force of reason,
duty, and religion.</p>

<p>Thus unfortunately are we circumstanced at this
time, my dear countrymen and fellow-citizens; we, I
mean, the middling people; the farmers, shopkeepers,
and tradesmen of this city and country. Through the
dissensions of our leaders, through mistaken principles
of religion, joined with a love of worldly power, on the
one hand; through pride, envy, and implacable resentment
on the other; our lives, our families, and little
fortunes, dear to us as any great man's can be to him,
are to remain continually exposed to destruction, from
an enterprising, cruel, now well-informed, and by success
encouraged, enemy. It seems as if heaven, justly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
displeased at our growing wickedness, and determined
to punish<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> this once-favoured land, had suffered our
chiefs to engage in these foolish and mischievous contentions,
for <em>little posts</em> and <em>paltry distinctions</em>, that our
hands might be bound up, our understandings darkened
and misled, and every means of our security neglected.
It seems as if our greatest men, our <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cives nobilissimi</i><a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> of
both parties, had sworn the ruin of the country, and
invited the French, our most inveterate enemy to destroy
it. Where then shall we seek for succour and
protection? The government we are immediately under
denies it to us; and if the enemy comes, we are <em>far
from Zidon, and there is no deliverer near</em>. Our case is
dangerously bad; but perhaps there is yet a remedy, if
we have but the prudence and the spirit to apply it.</p>

<p>If this new flourishing city, and greatly improving
colony, is destroyed and ruined, it will not be for want
of numbers of inhabitants able to bear arms in its defence.
It is computed, that we have at least (exclusive
of the Quakers) sixty thousand fighting men, acquainted
with fire arms, many of them hunters and
marksmen, hardy and bold. All we want is order, discipline,
and a few cannon. At present we are like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
separate filaments of flax before the thread is formed,
without strength, because without connection; but
<span class="xs lsp2">UNION</span> would make us strong, and even formidable.
Though the <em>great</em> should neither help nor join us;
though they should even oppose our uniting, from some
mean views of their own, yet, if we resolve upon it, and
it please God to inspire us with the necessary prudence
and vigour, it <em>may</em> be effected. Great numbers of our
people are of British race, and though the fierce fighting
animals of those happy islands are said to abate
their native fire and intrepidity, when removed to a foreign
clime, yet with the people it is not so; our neighbours
of New England afford the world a convincing
proof, that Britons, though a hundred years transplanted,
and to the remotest part of the earth, may yet
retain, even to the third and fourth descent, that zeal
for the public good, that military prowess, and that undaunted
spirit, which has in every age distinguished
their nation. What numbers have we likewise of <em>those
brave people</em>, whose fathers in the last age made so glorious
a stand for our religion and liberties, when invaded
by a powerful French army, joined by Irish Catholics,
under a bigotted popish king! Let the memorable siege
of Londonderry, and the signal actions of the Iniskillingers,
by which the heart of that prince's schemes
was broken, be perpetual testimonies of the courage
and conduct of those noble warriors! Nor are there
wanting amongst us, thousands of <em>that warlike</em> nation,
whose sons have ever since the time of Cæsar maintained
the character he gave their fathers, of joining
the most <em>obstinate courage</em> to all the other military virtues:
I mean the brave and steady Germans. Numbers
of whom have actually borne arms in the service
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
of their respective princes; and if they fought well for
their tyrants and oppressors, would they refuse to unite
with us in defence of their newly acquired and most
precious liberty and property? Were this union formed,
were we once united, thoroughly armed and disciplined,
was every thing in our power done for our security, as
far as human means and foresight could provide, we
might then, with more propriety, humbly ask the assistance
of Heaven, and a blessing on our lawful endeavours.
The very fame of our strength and readiness
would be a means of discouraging our enemies; for it
is a wise and true saying, that <em>one sword often keeps another
in the scabbard</em>. The way to secure peace is to be
prepared for war. They, that are on their guard, and
appear ready to receive their adversaries, are in much
less danger of being attacked, than the supine, secure
and negligent. We have yet a winter before us, which
may afford a good and almost sufficient opportunity for
this, if we seize and improve it with a becoming vigour.
And if the hints contained in this paper are so happy
as to meet with a suitable disposition of mind in his
countrymen and fellow-citizens, the writer of it will, in
a few days, lay before them a form of an <span class="xs lsp2">ASSOCIATION</span>
for the purposes herein mentioned, together with a
practicable scheme for raising the money necessary for
the defence of our trade, city, and country, without
laying a burthen on any man.</p>

<p><em>May the God of wisdom, strength, and power, the Lord
of the armies of Israel, inspire us with prudence in this time
of danger, take away from us all the seeds of contention
and division, and unite the hearts and counsels of all of us,

<p class="center">Letter I.</p>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Passy, near Paris, Aug. 21, 1784.</em></p>

<p class="xs pad2">MY DEAR OLD FRIEND,</p>

<p>I received your kind letter of May 3, 1783. I
am ashamed that it has been so long unanswered. The
indolence of old age, frequent indisposition, and too
much business, are my only excuses. I had great pleasure
in reading it, as it informed me of your welfare.</p>

<p>Your excellent little work, "The Principles of
Trade," is too little known. I wish you would send me
a copy of it by the bearer, my grandson and secretary,
whom I beg leave to recommend to your civilities. I
would get it translated and printed here, and if your
bookseller has any quantity of them left, I should be
glad he would send them to America. The ideas of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544a" id="Page_544a">[544*]</a></span>
our people there, though rather better than those that
prevail in Europe, are not so good as they should be:
and that piece might be of service among them.</p>

<p>Since and soon after the date of your letter, we lost,
unaccountably as well as unfortunately, that worthy,
valuable young man you mention, your namesake
Maddeson. He was infinitely regretted by all that
knew him.</p>

<p>I am sorry your favourite charity does not go on as
you could wish it. It is shrunk indeed by your admitting
only 60 children in a year. What you have told
your brethren respecting America is true. If you find
it difficult to dispose of your children in England, it
looks as if you had too many people. And yet you are
afraid of emigration. A subscription is lately set on
foot here to encourage and assist mothers in nursing
their infants themselves at home; the practice of sending
them to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Enfans Trouvés</i> having risen here to a
monstrous excess, as by the annual bills it appears they
amount to near one third of the children born in Paris.
This subscription is likely to succeed, and may do a
great deal of good, though it cannot answer all the
purposes of a foundling hospital.</p>

<p>Your eyes must continue very good, since you are
able to write so small a hand without spectacles. I
cannot distinguish a letter even of large print, but am
happy in the invention of double spectacles, which,
serving for distant objects as well as near ones, make
my eyes as useful to me as ever they were. If all the
other defects and infirmities of old age could be as
easily and cheaply remedied, it would be worth while,
my friend, to live a good deal longer. But I look upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545a" id="Page_545a">[545*]</a></span>
death to be as necessary to our constitutions as sleep.
We shall rise refreshed in the morning.&mdash;Adieu, and
believe me ever,</p>

<p class="right padr4">Your's most affectionately,</p>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Passy, May 19, 1785.</em></p>

<p class="xs pad2">DEAR OLD FRIEND,</p>

<p>I received the very good letter you sent me by
my grandson, together with your resemblance, which is
placed in my chamber and gives me great pleasure:
there is no trade, they say, without returns, and therefore
I am punctual in making those you have ordered.
I intended this should have been a long epistle, but I
am interrupted, and can only add, that I am ever,</p>

<p class="right padr4">Yours, most affectionately,</p>

<p class="right padr2">B. FRANKLIN.</p>

<p>My grandson presents his most affectionate respects.</p>

<p class="center">Letter III.</p>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Passy, May 23, 1785.</em></p>

<p class="xs pad2">DEAR OLD FRIEND,</p>

<p>I sent you a few lines the other day with the medallion,
when I should have written more, but was prevented
by the coming in of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bavard</i>, who worried me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546a" id="Page_546a">[546*]</a></span>
till evening. I bore with him, and now you are to
bear with me, for I shall probably <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bavarder</i> in answering
your letter.</p>

<p>I am not acquainted with the saying of Alphonsus,
which you allude to as a sanctification of your rigidity
in refusing to allow me the plea of old age as an excuse
for my want of exactitude in correspondence.
What was that saying?&mdash;You do not, it seems, feel any
occasion for such an excuse, though you are, as you
say, rising 75, but I am rising (perhaps more properly
falling) 80&mdash;and I leave the excuse with you till you
arrive at that age; perhaps you may then be more sensible
of its validity, and see fit to use it for yourself.</p>

<p>I must agree with you, that the gout is bad, and that
the stone is worse. I am happy in not having them
both together, and I join in your prayer, that you may
live till you die without either. But I doubt the author
of the epitaph you sent me is a little mistaken, when,
speaking of the world, he says, that</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; He ne'er car'd a pin</p>
<p class="verse">What they said or may say of the mortal within.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is so natural to wish to be well spoken of, whether
alive or dead, that I imagine he could not be quite
exempt from that desire, and that at least he wished to
be thought a wit, or he would not have given himself
the trouble of writing so good an epitaph to leave behind
him. Was it not worthy of his care, that the
world should say he was an honest and a good man? I
like better the concluding sentiment in the old song,
called the old man's wish, wherein, after wishing for a
warm house in a country town, an easy horse, some
good old authors, ingenious and cheerful companions,
pudding on Sundays, with stout ale and a bottle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547a" id="Page_547a">[547*]</a></span>
burgundy, &amp;c. &amp;c. in separate stanzas, each ending
with this burden,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">May I govern my passions with absolute sway,</p>
<p class="verse">And grow wiser and better as strength wears away,</p>
<p class="verse">Without gout or stone by a gentle decay&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">he adds for the last stanza,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">With courage undaunted may I face my last day,</p>
<p class="verse">And when I am gone may the better sort say,</p>
<p class="verse">In the morning when sober, in the evening when mellow,</p>
<p class="verse">He's gone&mdash;and not left behind him his fellow.</p>
<p class="verse">For he govern'd his passions, &amp;c.</p>
</div></div>

<p>What signifies our wishing? Things happen after
all as they will happen. I have sung that <em>wishing song</em>
a thousand times when I was young, and now find at
fourscore, that the three contraries have befallen me,
being subject to the gout, and the stone, and not being
yet master of all my passions. Like the proud girl in
my country, who wished and resolved not to marry a
parson, nor a presbyterian, nor an Irishman, and at
length found herself married to an Irish presbyterian
parson! You see I have some reason to wish that in a
future state I may not only be <em>as well as I was</em>, but a
little better. And I hope it: for I too, with your poet,
<em>trust in God</em>. And when I observe, that there is great
frugality as well as wisdom in his works, since he has
been evidently sparing, both of labour and materials;
for by the various wonderful inventions of propagation,
he has provided for the continual peopling his world
with plants and animals without being at the trouble of
repeated new creations; and by the natural reduction
of compound substances to their original elements,
capable of being employed in new compositions, he has
prevented the necessity of creating new matter; for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548a" id="Page_548a">[548*]</a></span>
that the earth, water, air, and perhaps fire, which being
compounded, form wood, do, when the wood is dissolved,
return, and again become air, earth, fire and
water:&mdash;I say, that when I see nothing annihilated, and
not even a drop of water wasted, I cannot suspect the
annihilation of souls, or believe that he will suffer the
daily waste of millions of minds ready made that now
exist, and put himself to the continual trouble of making
new ones. Thus finding myself to exist in the
world, I believe I shall in some shape or other always
exist. And with all the inconveniences human <em>life</em> is
liable to, I shall not object to a new edition of mine;
hoping, however, that the errata of the last may be
corrected.</p>

<p>I return your note of children received in the
foundling hospital at Paris, from 1741 to 1755 inclusive,
and I have added the years preceding, as far back
as 1710, together with the general christenings of the
city; and the years succeeding, down to 1770. Those
since that period I have not been able to obtain. I
have noted in the margin the gradual increase, viz.
from every tenth child so thrown upon the public, till it
comes to every third. Fifteen years have passed since
the last account, and probably it may now amount to
one half. Is it right to encourage this monstrous deficiency
of natural affection? A surgeon I met with
here excused the women of Paris, by saying seriously,
that they <em>could not</em> give suck, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Car, dit-il, ils n'ont point
de tetons</i>. He assured me it was a fact, and bade me
look at them, and observe how flat they were on the
breast; they have nothing more there, says he, than
I have upon the back of my hand. I have since
thought that there might be some truth in his observation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549a" id="Page_549a">[549*]</a></span>
and that possibly Nature finding they made no
use of bubbies, has left off giving them any. Yet since
Rousseau, with admirable eloquence pleaded for the
rights of children to their mother's milk, the mode has
changed a little, and some ladies of quality now suckle
their infants and find milk enough. May the mode
descend to the lower ranks, till it becomes no longer
the custom to pack their infants away, as soon as born,
to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Enfants Trouvés</i>, with the careless observation,
that the king is better able to maintain them. I am
credibly informed, that nine-tenths of them die there
pretty soon; which is said to be a great relief to the
institution, whose funds would not otherwise be sufficient
to bring up the remainder. Except the few persons
of quality above-mentioned, and the multitude
who send to the hospital, the practice is to hire nurses
in the country, to carry out the children and take care
of them there. Here is an office for examining the
health of nurses and giving them licences. They come
to town on certain days of the week in companies to receive
the children, and we often meet trains of them
on the road returning to the neighbouring villages with
each a child in arms. But those who are good enough
to try this way of raising their children are often not
able to pay the expence, so that the prisons of Paris
are crouded with wretched fathers and mothers confined
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour mois de nourice</i>; though it is laudably a favourite
charity to pay for them, and set such prisoners at
liberty. I wish success to the new project of assisting
the poor to keep their children at home, because I
think there is no nurse like a mother (or not many) and
that if parents did not immediately send their infants
out of their sight, they would in a few days begin to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550a" id="Page_550a">[550*]</a></span>
love them, and thence be spurred to greater industry
for their maintenance. This is a subject you understand
better than I, and therefore, having perhaps said
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'oo muc h'">too much</ins>, I drop it. I only add to the notes a remark
from the history of the Academy of Sciences, much in
favour of the foundling institution.</p>

<p>The Philadelphia bank goes on, as I hear, very well.
What you call the Cincinnati institution is no institution
of our government, but a private convention among
the officers of our late army, and so universally disliked
by the people, that it is supposed it will be dropped. It
was considered as an attempt to establish something
like an hereditary rank or nobility. I hold with you
that it was wrong; may I add, that all descending honours
are wrong and absurd; that the honour of virtuous
actions appertains only to him that performs
them, and is in its nature incommunicable. If it were
communicable by descent, it must also be divisible
among the descendants, and the more ancient the family
the less would be found existing in any one branch
of it; to say nothing of the greater chance of unlucky
interruptions.</p>

<p>Our constitution seems not to be well understood
with you. If the congress were a permanent body,
there would be more reason in being jealous of giving
it powers. But its members are chosen annually, and
cannot be chosen more than three years successively,
nor more than three years in seven, and any of them
may be recalled at any time, whenever their constituents
shall be dissatisfied with their conduct. They
are of the people, and return again to mix with the people,
having no more durable pre-eminence than the different
grains of sand in an hour-glass. Such an assembly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551a" id="Page_551a">[551*]</a></span>
cannot easily become dangerous to liberty. They
are the servants of the people, sent together to do the
people's business and promote the public welfare; their
powers must be sufficient, or their duties cannot be
performed. They have no profitable appointments,
but a mere payment of daily wages, such as are scarcely
equivalent to their expences, so that having no
chance for great places and enormous salaries or pensions,
as in some countries, there is no briguing or
bribing for elections. I wish old England were as
happy in its government, but I do not see it. Your
people, however, think their constitution the best in
the world, and affect to despise ours. It is comfortable
to have a good opinion of one's self, and of every
thing that belongs to us, to think one's own religion,
king, and wife, the best of all possible wives, kings, and
religions. I remember three Greenlanders, who had
travelled two years in Europe, under the care of some
Moravian missionaries, and had visited Germany, Denmark,
Holland and England, when I asked them at
Philadelphia (when they were in their way home)
whether, now they had seen how much more commodiously
the white people lived by the help of the arts,
they would not chuse to remain among us&mdash;their answer
was, that they were pleased with having had an
opportunity of seeing many fine things, <em>but they chose
to live in their own country</em>: which country, by the way,
consisted of rock only, for the Moravians were obliged
to carry earth in their ship from New York, for the
purpose of making there a cabbage garden!</p>

<p>By Mr. Dollond's saying, that my double spectacles
could only serve particular eyes, I doubt he has not
been rightly informed of their construction, I imagine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552a" id="Page_552a">[552*]</a></span>
it will be found pretty generally true, that the same
convexity of glass through which a man sees clearest
and best at the distance proper for reading, is not the
best for greater distances. I therefore had formerly
two pair of spectacles, which I shifted occasionally, as
in travelling I sometimes read and often want to regard
the prospects. Finding this change troublesome, and
not always sufficiently ready, I had the glasses cut out
and half of each kind associated in the same circle, the
least convex, for distant objects the upper half, and the
most convex, for reading, the lower half: by this means,
as I wear my spectacles constantly, I have only to
move my eyes up or down, as I want to see distinctly
far or near, the proper glasses being always ready.
This I find more particularly convenient since my being
in France; the glasses that serve me best at table to
see what I eat, being the best to see the faces of
those on the other side of the table who speak to me,
and when one's ears are not well accustomed to the
sounds of a language, a sight of the movements in the
features of him that speaks helps to explain; so that I
understand French better by the help of my spectacles.</p>

<p>My intended translator of your piece, the only one I
know who understands <em>the subject</em> as well as the two
languages, which a translator ought to do, or he cannot
make so good a translation, is at present occupied in
an affair that prevents his undertaking it; but that will
soon be over.&mdash;I thank you for the notes. I should be
glad to have another of the printed pamphlets.</p>

<p>We shall always be ready to take your children, if
you send them to us; I only wonder, that since London
draws to itself and consumes such numbers of your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553a" id="Page_553a">[553*]</a></span>
country people, your country should not, to supply
their places, want and willingly receive the children you
have to dispose of. That circumstance, together with
the multitude who voluntarily part with their freedom
as men, to serve for a time as lacqueys, or for life as
soldiers in consideration of small wages, seems to me a
proof that your island is over-peopled, and yet it is
afraid of emigrations! Adieu, my dear friend, and
believe me ever,</p>

<p class="right padr4">Yours, very affectionately,</p>

<p class="center">Letter IV.</p>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Philadelphia, May 18, 1787.</em></p>

<p>I received duly my good old friend's letter of the
19th of February, with a copy of one from Mr. Williams,
to whom I shall communicate it when I see him,
which I expect soon to do. He is generally a punctual
correspondent, and I am surprised you have not heard
from him.</p>

<p>I thank you much for your notes on banks; they are
just and solid, as far as I can judge of them. Our bank
here has met with great opposition, partly from envy,
and partly from those who wish an emission of more
paper-money, which they think the bank influence prevents.
But it has stood all attacks, and went on well
notwithstanding the assembly repealed its charter; a
new assembly has restored it; and the management is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554a" id="Page_554a">[554*]</a></span>
so prudent, that I have no doubt of its continuing to
go on well. The dividend has never been less than
6 per cent, nor will that be augmented for some time,
as the surplus profit is reserved to face accidents. The
dividend of 11 per cent, which was once made, was
from a circumstance scarce avoidable. A new company
was proposed, and prevented only by admitting a
number of new partners. As many of the first set were
averse to this, and chose to withdraw; it was necessary
to settle their accounts; so all were adjusted, the profits
shared that had been accumulated, and the new and
old proprietors jointly began on a new and equal footing.
Their notes are always instantly paid on demand,
and pass on all occasions as readily as silver, because
they will always produce silver.</p>

<p>Your medallion is in good company, it is placed with
those of Lord Chatham, Lord Camden, Marquis of
Rockingham, Sir George Savil, and some others, who
honoured me with a share of friendly regard when in
England. I believe I have thanked you for it, but I
thank you again.</p>

<p>I believe with you, that if our plenipotentiary is desirous
of concluding a treaty of commerce, he may need
patience. But if I were in his place, and not otherwise
instructed, I should be apt to say, Take your own time,
gentlemen. If the treaty cannot be made as much to
your advantage as to ours, don't make it. I am sure
the want of it is not more to our disadvantage than to
yours. Let the merchants on both sides treat with one
another. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Laissez les faire.</i></p>

<p>I have never considered attentively the congress
scheme for coining, and I have it not now at hand, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555a" id="Page_555a">[555*]</a></span>
that at present I can say nothing to it. The chief uses
of coining seem to be ascertaining the fineness of the
metals, and saving the time that would otherwise be
spent in weighing to ascertain the quantity. But the
convenience of fixed values to pieces is so great as to
force the currency of some whose stamp is worn off,
that should have assured their fineness, and which are
evidently not of half their due weight; this is the case
at present with the sixpences in England, which one
with another do not weigh three-pence.</p>

<p>You are now 78, and I am 82. You tread fast upon
my heels: but, though you have more strength and
spirit, you cannot come up with me till I stop; which
must now be soon; for I am grown so old as to have
buried most of the friends of my youth; and I now
often hear persons, whom I knew when children, called
<em>old</em> Mr. such a one, to distinguish them from their sons
now men grown, and in business; so that by living
twelve years beyond <em>David's</em> period, I seem to have
intruded myself into the company of posterity, when I
ought to have been a-bed and asleep. Yet had I gone
at 70, it would have cut off 12 of the most active years
of my life, employed too in matters of the greatest importance;
but whether I have been doing good or
mischief, is for time to discover. I only know that I
intended well, and I hope all will end well.</p>

<p>Be so good as to present my affectionate respects to
Dr. Rowley. I am under great obligations to him, and
shall write to him shortly. It will be a pleasure to
him to hear that my malady does not grow sensibly
worse, and that is a great point: for it has always
been so tolerable, as not to prevent my enjoying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556a" id="Page_556a">[556*]</a></span>
the pleasures of society, and being cheerful in
conversation. I owe this in a great measure to his
good counsels.</p>

<p class="right padr2">Adieu, my dear friend, and believe me ever,</p>

<p class="xs pad2">DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>I am hardly able to tell you how kindly I take
the letters with which you favour me. Your last, containing
an account of the death of our excellent friend,
Dr. Franklin, and the circumstances attending it, deserves
my particular gratitude. The account which he
has left of his life will show, in a striking example, how
a man, by talents, industry, and integrity, may rise
from obscurity to the first eminence and consequence
in the world; but it brings his history no lower than
the year 1757, and I understand, that since he sent
over the copy, which I have read, he has been able to
make no additions to it. It is with a melancholy regret
I think of his death; but to death we are all bound
by the irreversible order of nature, and in looking forward
to it, there is comfort in being able to reflect&mdash;that
we have not lived in vain, and that all the useful
and virtuous shall meet in a better country beyond the
grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Franklin, in the last letter I received from
him, after mentioning his age and infirmities, observes,
that it has been kindly ordered by the author of nature,
that, as we draw nearer the conclusion of life, we
are furnished with more helps to wean us from it,
among which one of the strongest is the loss of dear
friends. I was delighted with the account you gave in
your letter of the honour shown to his memory at Philadelphia,
and by congress; and yesterday I received a
high additional pleasure, by being informed, that the
national assembly of France had determined to go into
mourning for him<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>.&mdash;What a glorious scene is opened
there! The annals of the world furnish no parallel to
it. One of the honours of our departed friend is, that
he has contributed much to it.</p>

<p class="right padr8">I am, with great respect,</p>

<p class="right padr6">Your obliged and very</p>

<p class="right padr4">humble servant,</p>

William Smith, of Philadelphia.</em></a><a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></h3>

<p>I feel both the wish and the duty to communicate,
in compliance with your request, whatever, within
my knowledge, might render justice to the memory of
our great countryman, Dr. Franklin, in whom philosophy
has to deplore one of its principal luminaries
extinguished. But my opportunities of knowing the
interesting facts of his life have not been equal to my
desire of making them known.</p>

<p>I can only, therefore, testify in general, that there
appeared to me more respect and veneration attached
to the character of Dr. Franklin in France, than to
that of any other person in the same country, foreign
or native. I had opportunities of knowing particularly,
how far these sentiments were felt by the foreign
ambassadors and ministers at the court of Versailles.
The fable of his capture by the Algerines, propagated
by the English newspapers, excited no uneasiness, as it
was seen at once to be a dish cooked up to please
certain readers; but nothing could exceed the anxiety
of his diplomatic brethren on a subsequent report of his
death, which, although premature, bore some marks of
authenticity.</p>

<p>I found the ministers of France equally impressed
with his talents and integrity. The count de Vergennes,
particularly, gave me repeated and unequivocal
demonstrations of his entire confidence in him.</p>

<p>When he left Passy, it seemed as if the village had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
lost its patriarch. On taking leave of the court, which
he did by letter, the king ordered him to be handsomely
complimented, and furnished him with a litter and
mules of his own, the only kind of conveyance the state
of his health could bear.</p>

<p>The succession to Dr. Franklin, at the court of
France, was an excellent school of humility to me.
On being presented to any one, as the minister of
America, the common-place question was, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">c'est vous
Monsieur, qui remplacez le Docteur Franklin?</i>"&mdash;is it
you, sir, who replace Dr. Franklin? I generally
answered&mdash;"No one can replace him, sir; I am only
his successor."</p>

<p>I could here relate a number of those <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mots</i>, with
which he was used to charm every society, as having
heard many of them; but these are not your object.
Particulars of greater dignity happened not to occur,
during his stay of nine months after my arrival in
France.</p>

<p>A little before that time, Argand had invented his
celebrated lamp, in which the flame is spread into a
hollow cylinder, and thus brought into contact with
the air, within as well as without. Dr. Franklin had
been on the point of the same discovery. The idea
had occurred to him; but he had tried a bullrush as a
wick, which did not succeed. His occupations did not
permit him to repeat and extend his trials to the introduction
of a larger column of air, than could pass
through the stem of a bullrush.</p>

<p>About that time, also, the king of France gave him
a signal testimony of respect, by joining him with some
of the most illustrious men of the nation to examine
that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignis-fatuus</span> of philosophy, the animal magnetism
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
of the maniac, Mesmer; the pretended effects of which
had astonished all Paris. From Dr. Franklin's hand, in
conjunction with his brethren of the learned committee,
that compound of fraud and folly was unveiled, and
received its death-wound. After this nothing very
interesting was before the public, either in philosophy
or politics, during his stay; and he was principally occupied
in winding up his affairs, and preparing for his
return to America.</p>

<p>These small offerings to the memory of our great and
dear friend (whom time will be making still greater,
while it is spunging us from its records) must be accepted
by you, sir, in that spirit of love and veneration
for him, in which they are made; and not according to
their insignificancy in the eyes of a world, which did
not want this mite to fill up the measure of his worth.</p>

<p>His death was an affliction which was to happen to
us at some time or other. We have reason to be
thankful he was so long spared; that the most useful
life should be the longest also; that it was protracted
so far beyond the ordinary span allotted to humanity,
as to avail us of his wisdom and virtue, in the establishment
of our freedom in the west; and to bless him
with a view of its dawn in the east, where men seemed
till now to have learned every thing&mdash;but <em>how to be free</em>.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Letter from the late Dr. Joseph Priestley to the Editor
of the Monthly Magazine.</em></a><a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></h3>

<p class="xs pad2">SIR,</p>

<p>I have just read in the Monthly Review, vol. 36,
p. 357, that the late Mr. Pennant said of Dr. Franklin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
that, "living under the protection of our mild government,
he was secretly playing the incendiary, and too
successfully inflaming the minds of our fellow subjects
in America, till that great explosion happened, which
for ever disunited us from our once happy colonies."</p>

<p>As it is in my power, as far as my testimony will be
regarded, to refute this charge, I think it due to our
friendship to do it. It is probable, that no person now
living was better acquainted with Dr. Franklin and his
sentiments on all subjects of importance, than myself,
for several years before the American war. I think I
knew him as well as one man can generally know another.
At that time I spent the winters in London, in
the family of the Marquis of Lansdown, and few days
passed without my seeing more or less of Dr. Franklin;
and the last day that he passed in England, having
given out that he should depart the day before, we
spent together, without any interruption, from morning
till night.</p>

<p>Now he was so far from wishing for a rupture with
the colonies, that he did more than most men would
have done, to prevent it. His constant advice to his
countrymen, he always said, was "to bear every thing
from England, however unjust;" saying, that "it could
not last long, as they would soon outgrow all their hardships."
On this account Dr. Price, who then corresponded
with some of the principal persons in America,
said, he began to be very unpopular there. He always
said, "If there must be a war, it will be a war of ten
years, and I shall not live to see the end of it." This I
have heard him say many times.</p>

<p>It was at his request, enforced by that of Dr. Fothergil,
that I wrote an anonymous pamphlet, calculated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
to show the injustice and impolicy of a war with the
colonies, previous to the meeting of a new parliament.
As I then lived at Leeds, he corrected the press himself,
and, to a passage, in which I lamented the attempt
to establish arbitrary power in so large a part of the
British empire, he added the following clause, "to
the imminent danger of our most valuable commerce,
and of that national strength, security, and felicity,
which depend on union and on liberty."</p>

<p>The unity of the British empire, in all its parts, was
a favourite idea of his. He used to compare it to a
beautiful China vase, which, if once broken, could
never be put together again: and so great an admirer
was he at the time of the British constitution, that he said
he saw no inconvenience from its being extended over
a great part of the globe. With these sentiments he
left England; but when, on his arrival in America, he
found the war begun, and that there was no receding,
no man entered more warmly into the interests of what
he then considered as <em>his country</em>, in opposition to that
of Great Britain. Three of his letters to me, one written
immediately on his landing, and published in the
collection of his Miscellaneous Works, p. 365, 552, and
555<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>, will prove this.</p>

<p>By many persons, Dr. Franklin is considered as having
been a cold-hearted man, so callous to every feeling
of humanity, that the prospect of all the horrors of
a civil war could not affect him. This was far from
being the case. A great part of the day abovementioned
that we spent together, he was looking over a
number of American newspapers, directing me what
to extract from them for the English ones; and, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
reading them, he was frequently not able to proceed
for the tears literally running down his cheeks. To
strangers he was cold and reserved; but where he was
intimate, no man indulged to more pleasantry and good
humour. By this he was the delight of a club, to
which he alludes in one of the letters above referred to,
called the <em>whig-club</em>, that met at the London coffee-house,
of which Dr. Price, Dr. Kippis, Mr. John Lee,
and others of the same stamp, were members.</p>

<p>Hoping that this vindication of Dr. Franklin will
give pleasure to many of your readers, I shall proceed
to relate some particulars relating to his behaviour,
when lord Loughborough, then Mr. Wedderburn, pronounced
his violent invective against him at the privy-council,
on his presenting the complaints of the province
of Massachusetts (I think it was) against their
governor. Some of the particulars may be thought
amusing.</p>

<p>On the morning of the day on which the cause was
to be heard, I met Mr. Burke, in Parliament-street,
accompanied by Dr. Douglas, afterwards bishop of
Carlisle; and after introducing us to each other, as men
of letters, he asked me whither I was going? I said I
could tell him where I <em>wished</em> to go. He then asking
me where that was, I said to the privy-council, but that
I was afraid I could not get admission. He then desired
me to go along with him. Accordingly I did;
but when we got into the anti-room, we found it quite
filled with persons as desirous of getting admission as
ourselves. Seeing this, I said, we should never get
through the crowd. He said, "Give me your arm;"
and locking it fast in his, he soon made his way to the
door of the privy-council. I then said, Mr. Burke,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
you are an excellent leader; he replied, "I wish other
persons thought so too."</p>

<p>After waiting a short time, the door of the privy-council
opened, and we entered the first, when Mr.
Burke took his stand behind the first chair next to the
president, and I behind that the next to his. When the
business was opened, it was sufficiently evident, from
the speech of Mr. Wedderburn, who was counsel for
the governor, that the real object of the court was to
insult Dr. Franklin. All this time he stood in a corner
of the room, not far from me, without the least apparent
emotion.</p>

<p>Mr. Dunning, who was the leading counsel on the
part of the colony, was so hoarse, that he could hardly
make himself heard; and Mr. Lee, who was the second,
spoke but feebly in reply; so that Mr. Wedderburn
had a complete triumph. At the sallies of his sarcastic
wit, all the members of the council, the president himself
(Lord Gower) not excepted, frequently laughed
outright. No person belonging to the council behaved
with decent gravity, except Lord North, who, coming
late, took his stand behind the chair opposite to me.</p>

<p>When the business was over, Dr. Franklin, in going
out, took me by the hand, in a manner that indicated
some feeling. I soon followed him, and going through
the anti-room, saw Mr. Wedderburn there surrounded
with a circle of his friends and admirers. Being
known to him, he stepped forwards as if to speak to
me; but I turned aside, and made what haste I could
out of the place.</p>

<p>The next morning I breakfasted with the doctor,
when he said, "He had never before been so sensible
of the power of a good conscience; for that if he had
not considered the thing for which he had been so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
much insulted, as one of the best actions of his life, and
what he should certainly do again in the same circumstances,
he could not have supported it." He was accused
of clandestinely procuring certain letters, containing
complaints against the governor, and sending
them to America, with a view to excite their animosity
against him, and thus to embroil the two countries.
But he assured me, that he did not even know that
such letters existed, till they were brought to him as
agent for the colony, in order to be sent to his constituents;
and the cover of the letters on which the direction
had been written, being lost, he only guessed at
the person to whom they were addressed, by the contents.</p>

<p>That Dr. Franklin, notwithstanding he did not show
it at the time, was much impressed by the business of
the privy council, appeared from this circumstance:
when he attended there, he was dressed in a suit of
Manchester velvet; and Silas Dean told me, that,
when they met at Paris to sign the treaty between
France and America, he purposely put on that suit.</p>

<p>Hoping that this communication will be of some service
to the memory of Dr. Franklin, and gratify his
friends,</p>

<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been
corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within
the text and consultation of external sources.</p>

<p>For consistency and clarity, the pound abbreviation 'l.' has been italicized,
so for example '123,321l.' has been replaced by '123,321<em>l.</em>' in the etext.</p>

<p>For consistency, the date and salutation at the beginning of each
letter, and the closing and name at the end of each letter,
have been put on separate lines (they were sometimes placed on the
same line in the original printed text).</p>

<p>Three or more asterisks, sometimes spaced, were used by the editor
to indicate omitted text, and sometimes '&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;' or '&mdash;&mdash;' were used.
Missing names were indicated by '&mdash;&mdash;' or by '****'. For this reason
thought breaks in the text are indicated by two blank lines, not by
a line of asterisks.</p>

<p>A deliberate blank space in the text is indicated by [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;].</p>

<p>All the changes noted in the Errata (<a href="#ERRATA">pg vi</a>) have been applied to the text.</p>

<p>Many Footnotes have the signature 'B. V.' rather than 'Editor'. This is
explained in Vol 1 p 399 Footnote [90], and is copied below for the
reader's convenience:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">Wherever this signature occurs, the note is taken from a volume of
Dr. Franklin's writings, entitled Political, Miscellaneous, and
Philosophical Pieces, printed for Johnson, 1779. The editor of that
volume, though a young man at the time, had already evinced
extraordinary talents, and was the friend and correspondent of our
author. As he has chosen to withhold his name, we conceive ourselves
not entitled to disclose it: but we shall take the freedom of an
acquaintance to use the notes occasionally, deeming them in many
instances valuable historical records. Editor.</div>

<p>Except for those changes noted below, misspelling in the text, and
inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained. For example, compleat;
controul; inclose; smoaky; Pensylvania;  Massachussets; New-England,
New England; shopkeeper, shop-keeper.</p>

<p>The Index covers all three volumes and was originally printed
at the end of Volume 1 only. It has been copied to the end of
Volume 2 and 3 as a convenience for the reader.</p>

<p>The Index had no page numbers in the original text; page numbers from
1i to 36i have been added for completeness. For clarity, some volume
identifiers (i. or ii. or iii.) have been added, or removed, in the
Index. Only references within this volume have been hyperlinked.</p>

<p>The Index has some references to page numbers with a *, eg 551*.  These
are valid references; the book printer inserted pages 543*-556* between
pages 542 and 543 in Vol iii.</p>
